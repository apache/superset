# Superset MCP Service â€“ Phase 1 Status Update

## Background
The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a new protocol for exposing high-level, structured actions in Superset, designed for LLM agents and automation. Phase 1 delivers a foundational, extensible MCP service in Superset, leveraging internal APIs (DAOs/commands) and providing a versioned, developer-friendly interface for both Apache and Preset use cases. ([SIP-171](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/33870))

## Phase 1 Objectives (from SoW/SIP-171)
- Standalone MCP service, config flag, CLI, modular, stateless
- Strong typing: all actions use DAOs/commands and Pydantic schemas
- Clear extension points for Preset-specific auth, RBAC, and logging
- 3+ high-value MCP actions (list, info, mutation)
- Developer experience: easy to run, clear docs, tests
- Auth/RBAC/logging hooks stubbed, ready for enterprise
- Out of scope: full RBAC, impersonation, logging, external identity provider integration

## What's Delivered (Phase 1)
- **Service infrastructure**: ASGI-based FastMCP server, config flag, CLI (`superset mcp run`), stateless
- **Strong typing**: All tool input/output uses Pydantic v2 models with field descriptions
- **Modular tools**: Grouped by domain (`dashboard/`, `dataset/`, `chart/`, `system/`), shared abstractions in `model_tools.py` and `middleware.py`
- **Abstracted, reusable tools**: List, info, and available filters tools are now abstracted and reusable across datasets, charts, and dashboards
- **Tool registration**: All tool functions use `@mcp.tool` and `@mcp_auth_hook` decorators for registration and auth (no more add_tool); DAOs/commands imported inside function body
- **DAO wrapper removed**: The old dao wrapper has been removed for clarity and maintainability
- **Auth/RBAC/logging hooks**: Stubbed in `auth.py` and `middleware.py`, admin mode by default, ready for extension
- **Extension points**: Documented and ready for Preset/enterprise
- **Core actions implemented**:
  - `list_dashboards`, `list_datasets`, `list_charts` (all with enhanced search/filter, UUID/slug support)
  - `get_dashboard_info`, `get_dataset_info`, `get_chart_info` (multi-identifier support: ID/UUID/slug)
  - `get_dashboard_available_filters`, `get_dataset_available_filters`, `get_chart_available_filters`
  - `create_chart` (comprehensive chart creation with line, bar, area, scatter, table support and SQL aggregators)
  - `generate_explore_link` (temporary chart exploration without saving)
  - `get_superset_instance_info`
- **Tests**: Unit and integration tests for all core tools, with improved coverage and best practices. Chart creation tools now have comprehensive tests covering all supported chart types and SQL aggregators.
- **Docs**: Architecture, schemas, and dev guides up to date
- **Tool module reorganization**: Modules have been reorganized for clarity and maintainability
- **Enhanced chart creation**: Support for line, bar, area, scatter, and table charts with intelligent metric handling (simple strings and SQL aggregators)

## What's Next / Planned
- **Primary focus: chart_create tool enhancements**
  - Continue refining chart creation tool for better LLM-friendliness
  - Explore how prompt engineering can guide chart creation (e.g., mapping user intent to chart config)
  - Integrate prompt injection prevention from the start
  - Support creating a chart and navigating the user to Explore with the settings (without saving the chart)
  - Investigate backend rendering of charts for previews or agent feedback
  - Add mutation tools for iterating on charts, dashboards, datasets, etc. (e.g., update, refine, clone)
- More advanced mutations (create/update/delete)
- Navigation tools (e.g., generate_explore_link, open_sql_lab_with_context)
- Full RBAC, impersonation, logging (stubbed only in Phase 1)
- Preset/enterprise integration (hooks ready)
