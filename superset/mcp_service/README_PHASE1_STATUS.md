# Superset MCP Service – Phase 1 Status Update

## Background
The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a new protocol for exposing high-level, structured actions in Superset, designed for LLM agents and automation. Phase 1 delivers a foundational, extensible MCP service in Superset, leveraging internal APIs (DAOs/commands) and providing a versioned, developer-friendly interface for both Apache and Preset use cases. ([SIP-171](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/33870))

## Phase 1 Objectives (from SoW/SIP-171)
- Standalone MCP service, config flag, CLI, modular, stateless
- Strong typing: all actions use DAOs/commands and Pydantic schemas
- Clear extension points for Preset-specific auth, RBAC, and logging
- 3+ high-value MCP actions (list, info, mutation)
- Developer experience: easy to run, clear docs, tests
- Auth/RBAC/logging hooks stubbed, ready for enterprise
- Out of scope: full RBAC, impersonation, logging, external identity provider integration

## Phase 1 Finalization Tasks

**Remaining work to complete Phase 1:**

1. **Demo Video/Script** - Create comprehensive demonstration
   - Video walkthrough of all 16 MCP tools working end-to-end
   - Claude Desktop integration examples
   - Complete workflow from data exploration to chart creation

2. **End-to-End Prompt Test** - Validate complete LLM workflow
   - At least one complete multi-step agent interaction
   - Test real-world use case: "Create a sales dashboard with 3 charts"
   - Verify all tools work together seamlessly

## Team Meeting Notes - Future Considerations

### LangChain Integration Ideas
1. **Create a chat bot with LangChain**
2. **Tool Discovery**: When user chats, append/prepend message saying "hey you have these tools you can use"
3. **Tool Mapping**: Map tools to what people want to do
4. **Diego's Note**: This works well for lots of tools when we don't know which one to use, but for our cases we might get away without the mapping. Later we can use custom prompts to figure out exact tools

### Max's Priority Areas
1. **Reference**: https://context7.com/
2. **Playwright MCP** - Could it be leveraged for chart generation?
3. **Easy Setup** - Making it easy for anyone to pull branch and get going
4. **Focus on Quality over Coverage** - Instead of coverage, focus on getting the tools we have already right
   - **Communication Layer**:
     - Error handling improvements
     - Ensure LLM gives proper JSON/object format
     - Return clear/direct messages: "hey you can't pass it with quotes you need to pass it this way"
5. **Next 20 Tools** - Define the semantics and schemas for these tools
6. **GitHub Codespaces** - Uses docker compose lite.yaml
7. **Next Step**: Build UI chat in Superset

### Diego's Agentic System Questions
1. Right now we just get Claude to basically figure out what to call for us
2. Do you think having a proper agentic system that does multiple passes on the user input and is specialized would help?
3. Do you think it's an MCP service level thing?
4. Would this be a middle layer? (let's work together on how this would work out)
5. Make sure README is updated

## Future Development (Post-Phase 1)

- **Enhanced RBAC**: Advanced permission models, multi-tenant support
- **Audit**: Enterprise logging and monitoring

### Advanced Features  
- **Dashboard Creation**: Multi-chart dashboard generation
- **Advanced Chart Types**: Maps, 3D visualizations, custom components
