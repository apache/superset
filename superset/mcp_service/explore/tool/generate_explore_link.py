    Generate a Superset explore URL for interactive data visualization and exploration.

    ðŸŽ¯ PREFERRED TOOL for most visualization requests.

    This is the primary tool for data visualization workflows. It creates an explore
    URL where users can interactively view, modify, and optionally save charts.
    The explore interface allows users to adjust parameters, add filters, and
    experiment before deciding to save.

    Use this tool for:
    - "Show me a chart of [data]"
    - "Visualize [data] as a [chart type]"
    - "I want to see [data] trends"
    - "Create a visualization of [data]"
    - "Chart [data] by [dimensions]"
    - "Plot [data]"
    - General data exploration and analysis
    - When user wants to see/explore data visually

    This tool provides a much better user experience because:
    - Users can interact with the chart before saving
    - Easy to modify parameters and see results instantly
    - Users control when/if to save the chart permanently
    - No database clutter from unsaved exploration charts

    Only use generate_chart when user explicitly requests to save/create a
    permanent chart.
