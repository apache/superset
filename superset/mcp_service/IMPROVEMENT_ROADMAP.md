# MCP Service Improvement Roadmap

This document outlines potential improvements for the Superset MCP service, organized by priority.

## ðŸ”´ High Priority (Security & Reliability)

### 1. Error Handling Enhancement
- [ ] Implement global error handler middleware for consistent error responses
- [ ] Add retry logic for transient failures (database timeouts, screenshot generation)

### 2. Security Enhancements
- [ ] Add rate limiting middleware to prevent abuse
- [ ] Add field-level permissions for sensitive data

## ðŸŸ¡ Medium Priority (Performance & Monitoring)

### 3. Performance Optimizations
- [ ] Implement Redis-based caching for frequently accessed metadata
- [ ] Add pagination cursor support for batch operations in list endpoints
- [ ] Add support for streaming responses for large data exports

### 4. Security Enhancements (Continued)
- [ ] Implement request signing/validation for webhook-style integrations

### 5. Monitoring & Observability
- [ ] Add OpenTelemetry instrumentation for distributed tracing
- [ ] Add metrics collection for tool usage patterns

## ðŸŸ¢ Low Priority (Developer Experience & Architecture)

### 6. Monitoring & Observability (Continued)
- [ ] Implement health check endpoints beyond basic FastMCP support

### 7. Developer Tools
- [ ] Create a Swagger/OpenAPI spec generator from Pydantic schemas
- [ ] Add development mode with request/response logging
- [ ] Add GraphQL-style field selection for list operations

### 8. Architecture Refinements
- [ ] Extract screenshot service into separate microservice
- [ ] Implement plugin system for custom tools

## Implementation Notes

### Error Handling & Retry Logic
Consider using libraries like:
- `tenacity` for retry logic with exponential backoff
- Custom FastMCP middleware for global error handling

### Redis Caching
- Use existing Superset Redis connections where possible
- Cache frequently accessed metadata (dataset schemas, dashboard configs)
- Set appropriate TTLs based on data volatility

### Rate Limiting
- Consider `slowapi` (Starlette-based rate limiter)
- Implement per-user and per-IP limits
- Add bypass for internal services

### OpenTelemetry
- Use `opentelemetry-instrumentation-fastapi`
- Integrate with existing Superset telemetry if available
- Track tool usage, response times, error rates

### Field-Level Permissions
- Extend existing RBAC system
- Define sensitive fields in schema metadata
- Filter responses based on user permissions

### Streaming Responses
- Use Server-Sent Events (SSE) for large exports
- Implement chunked transfer encoding
- Add progress indicators for long-running operations

## Success Metrics

- **Error Rate**: < 0.1% for non-user errors
- **Response Time**: P95 < 500ms for metadata operations
- **Cache Hit Rate**: > 80% for frequently accessed data
- **Security**: Zero unauthorized data access incidents
- **Developer Satisfaction**: Reduced time to implement new tools

## Timeline Estimates

- **High Priority**: 2-3 sprints (4-6 weeks)
- **Medium Priority**: 3-4 sprints (6-8 weeks)
- **Low Priority**: As resources allow

## Dependencies

- Coordination with Superset core team for:
  - Redis connection sharing
  - RBAC integration
  - Telemetry standards
- Infrastructure support for:
  - Redis deployment (if not existing)
  - APM/monitoring tools
  - Rate limiting at edge (optional)
