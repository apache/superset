Minimal authentication hooks for MCP tools.
This is a placeholder implementation that provides basic user context.

Future enhancements (to be added in separate PRs):
- JWT token authentication and validation
- User impersonation support
- Permission checking with scopes
- Comprehensive audit logging
- Field-level permissions
