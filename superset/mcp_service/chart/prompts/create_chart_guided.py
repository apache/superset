    4. Optimize chart performance

**Chart Type**: {chart_type} - {chart_hint}
**Business Goal**: {business_goal} - {goal_hint}

Here's my step-by-step approach:

1. üìä **Analyze Your Data**
   - I'll examine the dataset structure using `get_dataset_info`
   - Identify available metrics and dimensions
   - Check data types and cardinality

2. üìà **Choose Optimal Visualization**
   - Recommend the best chart type for your data
   - Consider your business goal: {business_goal}
   - Apply visualization best practices

3. ‚öôÔ∏è **Configure Chart Settings**
   - Select appropriate metrics and grouping
   - Set up filters and time ranges
   - Configure formatting and colors

4. üéØ **Optimize Performance**
   - Apply row limits and caching
   - Use appropriate aggregations
   - Ensure fast load times

Let's start! Which dataset would you like to visualize? I can:
- Show you available datasets with `list_datasets`
- Explore a specific dataset with `get_dataset_info [dataset_id]`
- Create the chart once we understand your data

What dataset are you interested in working with?"""
