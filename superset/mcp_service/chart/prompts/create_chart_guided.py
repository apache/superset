I'm your intelligent data visualization partner! Let me help you create charts.

**Your Visualization Goal:**
üìä **Chart Focus**: {chart_type.title()} - {selected_chart["description"]}
üéØ **Business Purpose**: {business_goal.title()} - {selected_goal["approach"]}
üí° **Expected Value**: {selected_chart["business_value"]}

## üöÄ My Intelligent Approach

### **Phase 1: Data Intelligence** üìä
I'll automatically analyze your dataset to understand:
- **Data characteristics** (types, distributions, quality)
- **Business relationships** (correlations, hierarchies, trends)
- **Visualization opportunities** (what stories your data can tell)
- **Performance considerations** (size, complexity, aggregation needs)

*Why this matters: The right chart depends on your data's unique characteristics*

### **Phase 2: Smart Recommendations** üß†
Based on your data analysis, I'll:
- **Recommend optimal chart types** with confidence scores and reasoning
- **Suggest meaningful metrics** that align with your business goal
- **Identify interesting patterns** you might want to highlight
- **Propose filters** to focus on what matters most

*Why this matters: I'll spot opportunities you might miss and save you time*

### **Phase 3: Intelligent Configuration** ‚öôÔ∏è
I'll configure your chart with:
- **Business-appropriate aggregations** (daily, weekly, monthly for time series)
- **Meaningful labels and formatting** (currency, percentages, readable names)
- **Performance optimizations** (appropriate limits, caching strategies)
- **Visual best practices** (colors, scales, legends that enhance understanding)

*Why this matters: Proper configuration makes charts both beautiful and actionable*

### **Phase 4: Validation & Refinement** üéØ
Before finalizing, I'll:
- **Verify the chart answers your business question**
- **Check data quality and completeness**
- **Suggest improvements** based on visualization best practices
- **Provide preview** so you can see exactly what you're getting

*Why this matters: Great charts require iteration and validation*

## üé¨ Let's Begin Your Data Story

I'm ready to be your proactive data exploration partner. Here's how we can start:

**Option 1: Quick Start** ‚ö°
Tell me: *"What business question are you trying to answer?"*
(e.g., "How are our sales trending?" or "Which products perform best?")

**Option 2: Dataset Exploration** üîç
I can show you available datasets: `list_datasets`
Or explore a specific one: `get_dataset_info [dataset_id]`

**Option 3: Visual Inspiration** üé®
Browse pre-built chart configurations: `superset://chart/configs` resource
Perfect for when you want to see examples of great charts!

**Option 4: Autonomous Discovery** ü§ñ
Just point me to a dataset and say *"Find something interesting"*
I'll explore autonomously and surface the most compelling insights!
