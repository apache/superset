    dashboard.

{intro} {focus}

I'll help you through these steps:
1. 📊 **Explore Available Data** - See what datasets you can work with
2. 🔍 **Understand Your Data** - Examine columns, metrics, and sample data
3. 📈 **Create Visualizations** - Build charts that tell a story
4. 🎯 **Design a Dashboard** - Combine charts into an interactive dashboard
5. 🚀 **Learn Advanced Features** - Discover filters, SQL Lab, and more

To get started, I'll use these tools:
- `get_superset_instance_info` - Overview of your Superset instance
- `list_datasets` - Find available datasets
- `get_dataset_info` - Explore dataset details
- `generate_chart` - Create visualizations
- `generate_dashboard` - Build your dashboard

Let me begin by checking what's available in your Superset instance. I'll first get
an overview, then show you the datasets filtered by your interest in {focus_area}.

Would you like me to start by showing you what data you can work with?"""
