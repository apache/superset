"""Decoration: turn raw change-records into the ActivityRecord DTO.

After fetching + filtering, each record needs the synthesized fields
the API contract documents — ``entity_kind`` translated to the user-
facing form, ``entity_uuid``, ``entity_deleted`` /
``entity_deletion_state``, ``source`` (self vs. related),
``summary`` (the AV-012 headline), ``impact`` (chart-count for
dashboard→dataset records), ``version_uuid``, ``changed_by``.

This module collects all those decorations:

* :func:`decorate_records` — orchestrates the per-page additions in
  one pass: pulls tombstones + uuids + impact counts in batches, then
  walks records adding the synthesized fields and stripping the
  internal-only columns the API contract doesn't expose.
* :func:`_lookup_entity_uuids` — one IN-clause query per kind to
  resolve live ``uuid`` for non-tombstoned entities.
* :func:`_build_summary` — pure projection of (api_kind, record kind,
  entity_name) onto the AV-012 headline string.
* :func:`_changed_by_dict` — projects the user columns onto the
  ``changed_by`` DTO shape.
