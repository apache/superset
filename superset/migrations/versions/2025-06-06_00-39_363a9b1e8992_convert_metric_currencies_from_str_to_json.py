    No op downgrade.

    The downgrade could just do `metric.currency = json.dumps(metric.currency)`. However
    this is happening after `f1edd4a4d4f2` which already converted the currency column
    to JSON at the DB level, so we shouldn't have currencies in str anymore. It was the
    case because the client was still stringifying it.
