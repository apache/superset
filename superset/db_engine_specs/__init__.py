"""Compatibility layer for different database engines

This modules stores logic specific to different database engines. Things
like time-related functions that are similar but not identical, or
information as to expose certain features or not and how to expose them.

For instance, Hive/Presto supports partitions and have a specific API to
list partitions. Other databases like Vertica also support partitions but
have different API to get to them. Other databases don't support partitions
at all. The classes here will use a common interface to specify all this.

The general idea is to use static classes and an inheritance scheme.
