/**
 * Indexing is the most important part of search. A proper index allows query terms to be matched to related results in
 * an efficient manner.
 *
 * <p>The simplest index strategy is to only index on a token. Other strategies can often be more useful though. For
 * example a prefix indexing strategy (e.g. "cat" to "c", "ca", "cat") allows users to search as they type, gradually
 * refining results as the search query becomes more detailed.
