    Route methods are a FAB concept around ModelView and RestModelView
    classes in FAB. Derivatives can define `include_route_method` and
    `exclude_route_methods` class attribute as a set of methods that
    will or won't get exposed.

    This class is a collection of static constants to reference common
    route methods, namely the ones defined in the base classes in FAB
