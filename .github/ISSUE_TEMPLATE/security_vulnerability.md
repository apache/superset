## DO NOT REPORT SECURITY VULNERABILITIES HERE

Please report security vulnerabilities to private@superset.apache.org.

In the event a community member discovers a security flaw in Superset, it is important to follow the [Apache Security Guidelines](https://www.apache.org/security/committers.html) and release a fix as quickly as possible before public disclosure. Reporting security vulnerabilities through the usual GitHub Issues channel is not ideal as it will publicize the flaw before a fix can be applied.
