# Workflow name
name: 'Chromatic Pull Request'

# This will allow us to see how the Storybook builds when a PR has been created that has changes in the frontend folder
# NOTE: pull_request_target actions will always run the version of this action on master branch
# you will not see changes in the action behavior until this action's changes have been merged to master.
# This is a security precaution so that PR coming from a fork cannot access a Github secret without a repo
# committer aproving and merging the PR declaring the action safe.
on:
  pull_request_target:

    # We want this action to run under specific pull request changes
    # opened: pull request is created
    # synchronize: commit(s) pushed to the pull request

    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]
    # This action will only run if one or more files have changes under the superset-frontend folder
