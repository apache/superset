            ### WARNING: Prefer TypeScript

            Looks like your PR contains new `.js` or `.jsx` files:

            ```
            ${{steps.check.outputs.js_files_added}}
            ```

            As decided in [SIP-36](https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/issues/9101), all new frontend code should be written in TypeScript. Please convert above files to TypeScript then re-request review.
