inputs:
  token:
    description: The GITHUB_TOKEN secret of the repository
    required: true
  sourceRunId:
    description: |
      The run that triggered the action. It should be set to
      `$\{\{ github.event.workflow_run.id` variable \}\}` if used in `workflow_run` triggered run if
      you want to act on source workflow rather than the triggered run.
    required: false
  notifyPRCancel:
    description: |
      Boolean. If set to true, it notifies the cancelled PRs with a comment containing reason why
      they are being cancelled.
    required: false
  notifyPRCancelMessage:
    description: |
      Optional cancel message to use instead of the default one when notifyPRCancel is true. Only
      used in 'self' cancel mode.
    required: false
  notifyPRMessageStart:
    description: |
      Only for workflow_run events triggered by the PRs. If not empty, it notifies those PRs with the
      message specified at the start of the workflow - adding the link to the triggered workflow_run.
    required: false
  cancelMode:
    description: |
      The mode of cancel. One of:
          * `duplicates`    - cancels duplicate runs from the same repo/branch as local run or
                              sourceId workflow. This is the default mode when cancelMode is not specified.
          * `allDuplicates` - cancels duplicate runs from all workflows. It is more aggressive version of
                              duplicate canceling - as it cancels all duplicates. It is helpful in case
                              of long queues of builds - as it is enough that one of the workflows that
                              cancel duplicates is executed, it can effectively clean-up the queue in this
                              case for all the future, queued runs.
          * `self`          - cancels self run - either own run if sourceRunId is not set, or
                              the source run that triggered the `workflow_run'
          * `failedJobs`    - cancels all runs that failed in jobs matching one of the regexps
          * `namedJobs`     - cancels runs where names of some jobs match some of regexps
    required: false
  cancelFutureDuplicates:
    description: |
      In case of duplicate canceling, cancel also future duplicates leaving only the "freshest" running
      job and not all the future jobs. By default it is set to true.
    required: false
  selfPreservation:
    description: |
      Do not cancel your own run. There are cases where selfPreservation should be disabled but it is
      enabled by default. You can disable it by setting 'false' as value.
    required: false
  jobNameRegexps:
    description: |
      Array of job name regexps (JSON-encoded string). Used by `failedJobs` and `namedJobs` cancel modes
      to match job names of workflow runs.
    required: false
  skipEventTypes:
    description: |
      Array of event names that should be skipped when cancelling (JSON-encoded string). This might be used
      in order to skip direct pushes or scheduled events.
    required: false
  workflowFileName:
    description: |
      Name of the workflow file. It can be used if you want to cancel a different workflow than yours.
