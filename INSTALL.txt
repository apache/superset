# Dependencies
#############################
# Superset runs best on python3.6
# Also recommended is the latest long term supported node / npm
# For complementary information read our CONTRIBUTING.md
# for OS level dependencies find instructions here:
# http://superset.apache.org/installation.html

# Fetch npm dependencies
cd superset/assets/
npm ci

# Build the Javascript bundles
npm run build

# Back to the root of the repo
cd ../..

# [optional] Superset pulls in quite a lot of dependencies in order
# to connect to other services. You might want to test or run Superset
# from a virtual env to make sure those dependencies are separated
# from your system wide versions
python3 -m env36
source env36/bin/activate

# [required] building and installing by pip (preferred)
pip install .

# superset --help
