"""
Tests db_engine_specs.db2 against a real IBM Db2 instance, spun up on
demand via testcontainers. Run via .github/workflows/testcontainers.yml.

icr.io/db2_community/db2 only publishes amd64/ppc64le/s390x images (no
arm64 build), so this cannot run locally on an Apple Silicon machine. It
runs natively on GitHub Actions' x86_64 runners. Db2 is also a notably slow
starter (a full instance bring-up, not just a process start) -- expect this
module alone to take several minutes.
