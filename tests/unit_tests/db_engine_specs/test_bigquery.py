def test_get_fields(app_context: AppContext) -> None:
    """
    Test the custom ``_get_fields`` method.

    The method adds custom labels (aliases) to the columns to prevent
    collision when referencing record fields. Eg, if we had these two
    columns:

        name STRING
        project STRUCT<name STRING>

    One could write this query:

        SELECT
            `name`,
            `project`.`name`
        FROM
            the_table

    But then both columns would get aliased as "name".

    The custom method will replace the fields so that the final query
    looks like this:

        SELECT
            `name` AS `name`,
            `project`.`name` AS project__name
        FROM
            the_table

def test_select_star(mocker: MockFixture, app_context: AppContext) -> None:

    The method removes pseudo-columns from structures inside arrays. While these
    pseudo-columns show up as "columns" for metadata reasons, we can't select them
    in the query, as opposed to fields from non-array structures.
