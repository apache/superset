# Superset Frontend Linting

Apache Superset uses a hybrid linting approach combining OXC (Oxidation Compiler) for standard rules and a custom AST-based checker for Superset-specific rules.

## Architecture

The linting system consists of two components:

1. **OXC Linter** (`oxlint`) - A Rust-based linter that's 50-100x faster than ESLint
   - Handles all standard JavaScript/TypeScript rules
   - Configured via `oxlint.json`
   - Runs via `npm run lint` or `npm run lint-fix`

2. **Custom Rules Checker** - A Node.js AST-based checker for Superset-specific patterns
   - Enforces no literal colors (use theme colors)
   - Prevents FontAwesome usage (use @superset-ui/core Icons)
   - Validates i18n template usage (no template variables)
   - Runs via `npm run check:custom-rules`

## Usage

### Quick Commands

```bash
# Run both OXC and custom rules
npm run lint:full

# Run OXC linter only (faster for most checks)
npm run lint

# Fix auto-fixable issues with OXC
npm run lint-fix

# Run custom rules checker only
npm run check:custom-rules

# Run on specific files
npm run lint-fix src/components/Button/index.tsx
npm run check:custom-rules src/theme/*.tsx
```

### Pre-commit Hooks

The linting system is integrated with pre-commit hooks:

```bash
# Install pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install

# Run hooks manually on staged files
pre-commit run

# Run on specific files
pre-commit run --files superset-frontend/src/file.tsx
```

## Configuration

### OXC Configuration (`oxlint.json`)

The OXC configuration includes:
- Standard ESLint rules
- React and React Hooks rules
- TypeScript rules
- Import/export rules
- JSX accessibility rules
- Unicorn rules for additional coverage

### Custom Rules

The custom rules are implemented in `scripts/check-custom-rules.js` and check for:

1. **No Literal Colors**: Enforces using theme colors instead of hardcoded hex/rgb values
2. **No FontAwesome**: Requires using `@superset-ui/core` Icons component
3. **Proper i18n Usage**: Prevents template variables in translation functions

## Performance

The hybrid approach provides:
- **50-100x faster linting** compared to ESLint for standard rules via OXC
- **Selective checking** - custom rules only run on changed files during pre-commit
- **Parallel execution** - OXC and custom rules can run concurrently

## Troubleshooting

### "Plugin 'basic-custom-plugin' not found" Error

If you see this error when running `npm run lint`, ensure you're using the explicit config:
```bash
npx oxlint --config oxlint.json
```

### Custom Rules Not Running

Verify the AST parsing dependencies are installed:
```bash
npm ls @babel/parser @babel/traverse glob
```

### Pre-commit Hook Failures

Ensure your changes are staged:
```bash
git add .
pre-commit run
```

## Development

### Adding New Custom Rules

1. Edit `scripts/check-custom-rules.js`
2. Add a new check function following the pattern:
```javascript
function checkNewRule(ast, filepath) {
  traverse(ast, {
    // AST visitor pattern
  });
}
```
3. Call the function in `processFile()`

### Updating OXC Rules

1. Edit `oxlint.json`
2. Test with `npm run lint`
3. Update ignore patterns if needed

## Migration from ESLint

This hybrid approach replaces the previous ESLint setup while maintaining all custom Superset linting rules. The migration provides:
- Significantly faster linting (50-100x improvement)
- Compatibility with Apache Software Foundation requirements (no custom binaries)
- Maintainable JavaScript-based custom rules

## CI/CD Integration

The linting system is integrated into CI via GitHub Actions. See `.github/workflows/superset-frontend-lint.yml` for the CI configuration.
