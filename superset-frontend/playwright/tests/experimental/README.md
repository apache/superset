# Experimental Playwright Tests

This directory contains Playwright tests that are still under development or validation.

## Purpose

Tests in this directory run in "shadow mode" with `continue-on-error: true` in CI:
- Failures do NOT block PR merges
- Allows tests to run in CI to validate stability before promotion
- Provides visibility into test reliability over time

## Promoting Tests to Stable

Once a test has proven stable (no false positives/negatives over sufficient time):

1. Move the test file out of `experimental/` to the appropriate feature directory:
   ```bash
   git mv playwright/tests/experimental/dashboard/test.spec.ts playwright/tests/dashboard/
   ```

2. The test will automatically become required for merge

## Test Organization

Organize tests by feature area:
- `auth/` - Authentication and authorization tests
- `dashboard/` - Dashboard functionality tests
- `explore/` - Chart builder tests
- `sqllab/` - SQL Lab tests
- etc.

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all experimental tests
npm run playwright:test -- experimental/

# Run specific experimental test
npm run playwright:test -- experimental/dashboard/test.spec.ts

# Run in UI mode for debugging
npm run playwright:ui -- experimental/
```
