   * This function is called after a successful response has been
   * received from the chart data endpoint, and is used to transform
   * the incoming data prior to being sent to the Visualization.
   *
   * The transformProps function is also quite useful to return
   * additional/modified props to your data viz component. The formData
   * can also be accessed from your <%= packageLabel %>.tsx file, but
   * doing supplying custom props here is often handy for integrating third
   * party libraries that rely on specific props.
   *
   * A description of properties in `chartProps`:
   * - `height`, `width`: the height/width of the DOM element in which
   *   the chart is located
   * - `formData`: the chart data request payload that was sent to the
   *   backend.
   * - `queryData`: the chart data response payload that was received
   *   from the backend. Some notable properties of `queryData`:
   *   - `data`: an array with data, each row with an object mapping
   *     the column/alias to its value. Example:
   *     `[{ col1: 'abc', metric1: 10 }, { col1: 'xyz', metric1: 20 }]`
   *   - `rowcount`: the number of rows in `data`
   *   - `query`: the query that was issued.
   *
   * Please note: the transformProps function gets cached when the
   * application loads. When making changes to the `transformProps`
   * function during development with hot reloading, changes won't
   * be seen until restarting the development server.
