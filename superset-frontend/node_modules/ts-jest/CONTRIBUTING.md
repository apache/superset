# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via [slack](https://bit.ly/3bRHFPQ) or [issue](https://github.com/kulshekhar/ts-jest/issues) with the owners of this repository before making a change.

Please note we have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure the tests are passing and that you have latest `master` branch merged in.
2. Update the `docs/` with details of your changes if required.
3. If possible, squash your commits. There must be only one commit in your PR (until a review). Then after each review requesting changes, DO NOT squash your commits with the one before the review, so that we can see intermediate modifications.
4. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.
