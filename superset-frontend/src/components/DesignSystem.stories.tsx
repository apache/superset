  # Superset Design System

  A design system is a complete set of standards intended to manage design at scale using reusable components and patterns.

  You can get an overview of Atomic Design concepts and a link to the full book on the topic here:

  <a href="https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/" target="_blank">
    Intro to Atomic Design
  </a>

  While the Superset Design System will use Atomic Design principles, we choose a different language to describe the elements.

  | Atomic Design   |    Atoms    | Molecules  | Organisms | Templates | Pages / Screens |
  | :-------------- | :---------: | :--------: | :-------: | :-------: | :-------------: |
  | Superset Design | Foundations | Components | Patterns  | Templates |    Features     |
