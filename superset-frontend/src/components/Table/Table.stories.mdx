# Usage

A table is UI that allows the user to explore data in a tabular format.

Common table applications in Superset:

- Display lists of user-generated entities (e.g. dashboard, charts, queries) for further exploration and use
- Display data that can help the user make a decision (e.g. query results)

# Variations

The table component has several variations.

### Size

**Large** - Column header and cell width set to 44 px. This is the recommended size for displaying lists of user-generated entities (e.g. dashboard, charts, queries) for further exploration and use.

**Small** - Column header and cell width set to 32 px. This is the recommended size for displaying data that can help the user make a decision (e.g. query results). Note that not all cell types (see below) can be used in small table sizes.

### Cell content

The following data types can be displayed in table cells.

- Text
  - w/ icons
- Hyperlink text
  - w/ icons
- Icon
- Button (Large size only)
- Icon button (Large size only)(Cell is limited to one icon button. If you need to provide multiple actions to the user from a table cell, use the ellipses icon button to open a menu containing available actions.)
- Single select field (Large size only)
- Toggle (Large size only)

### Loading

**Pagination** - Table displays set number of rows at a time, user navigates table via pagination. Use in scenarios where the user is searching for a specific piece of content.

**Infinite scroll** - Table displays a set number of rows at a time, then loads more as the user scrolls. Use in scenarios where the user is browsing dynamic information.

Pagination may also be used over infinite scroll for performance optimization.

### Toolbar

The table component can include a toolbar that can contain one or more of the following sub-components:

- **Title** - Includes a name for the table
- **Buttons** - Allows the user to perform global actions (e.g. select all, add to table) related to table entities
- **Search** - Allows the user to filter the table by a matching string
