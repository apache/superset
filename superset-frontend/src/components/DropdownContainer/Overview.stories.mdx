# Usage

The dropdown container is used to display elements horizontally in a responsive way. If the elements don't fit in
the available width, they are displayed vertically in a dropdown. Some of the common applications in Superset are:

- Display chart filters in the CRUD views
- Horizontally display native filters in a dashboard

# Variations

The component accepts any React element which ensures a high level of variability in Superset.

To check the component in detail and its interactions, check the [DropdownContainer](/story/design-system-components-dropdowncontainer--component) page.
