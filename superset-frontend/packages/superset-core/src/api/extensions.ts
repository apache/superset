/**
 * Namespace for dealing with installed extensions. Extensions are represented
 * by an {@link Extension}-interface which enables reflection on them.
 *
 * Extension writers can provide APIs to other extensions by returning their API public
 * surface from the `activate`-call.
 *
 * ```javascript
 * export function activate(context: vscode.ExtensionContext) {
 * 	let api = {
 * 		sum(a, b) {
 * 			return a + b;
 * 		},
 * 		mul(a, b) {
 * 			return a * b;
 * 		}
 * 	};
 * 	// 'export' public api-surface
 * 	return api;
 * }
 * ```
 * When depending on the API of another extension add an `extensionDependencies`-entry
 * to `package.json`, and use the {@link extensions.getExtension getExtension}-function
 * and the {@link Extension.exports exports}-property, like below:
 *
 * ```javascript
 * let mathExt = extensions.getExtension('genius.math');
 * let importedApi = mathExt.exports;
 *
 * console.log(importedApi.mul(42, 1));
 * ```
