/**
 * @fileoverview Views registration API for Superset extensions.
 *
 * This module provides functions for registering custom React views
 * at specific locations in the Superset UI. Views are registered as
 * module-level side effects at import time.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * import { views } from '@apache-superset/core';
 *
 * views.registerView(
 *   { id: 'my_ext.result_stats', name: 'Result Stats', location: 'sqllab.panels' },
 *   ResultStatsPanel,
 * );
 * ```

/**
 * Registers a custom view at a specific UI location.
 *
 * The view provider function is called when the UI renders the location,

 * @param location The location where this view should appear (e.g. "sqllab.panels").
 * @param component The React component to render at that location.
 * @returns A Disposable that unregisters the view when disposed.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * views.registerView(
 *   { id: 'my_ext.result_stats', name: 'Result Stats' },
 *   'sqllab.panels',
 *   ResultStatsPanel,
