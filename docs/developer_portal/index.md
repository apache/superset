# Superset Developer Portal

Welcome to the Apache Superset Developer Portal! This is your comprehensive guide to extending and customizing Superset through our new extension architecture.

## What are Superset Extensions?

Superset Extensions provide a powerful way to enhance and customize Apache Superset without modifying the core codebase. Following the successful model pioneered by VS Code, our extension architecture enables developers to:

- **Add custom features** to SQL Lab and other Superset modules
- **Create reusable components** that can be shared across organizations
- **Integrate external tools** and services seamlessly
- **Customize workflows** to match your team's specific needs

## Why Extensions?

As Superset has grown, we've recognized the need for a more modular architecture that allows:

- **Innovation without fragmentation** - Build features without forking the codebase
- **Community-driven development** - Share and reuse extensions across organizations
- **Stable APIs** - Develop against versioned, well-documented interfaces
- **Rapid iteration** - Deploy custom features without waiting for core releases

## Key Features

### ðŸŽ¯ Well-Defined Extension Points

Extensions can contribute to specific areas of Superset:
- SQL Lab panels (left, right, bottom, editor)
- Custom commands and menu items
- Status bar components
- API endpoints and backend functionality

### ðŸ”§ Modern Development Experience

- **CLI tools** for scaffolding, building, and packaging
- **Hot reloading** during development
- **TypeScript support** with full type safety
- **Module Federation** for dynamic loading

### ðŸ“¦ Simple Distribution

- Package extensions as `.supx` files
- Upload via REST API or UI
- Automatic activation and lifecycle management
- Version compatibility checking

## Getting Started

Ready to build your first extension? Check out our [Getting Started Guide](./getting-started) to:

1. Set up your development environment
2. Create your first extension
3. Test it locally
4. Package and deploy it

## Architecture Overview

Our extension architecture is built on several key principles:

- **Lean Core**: Keep Superset's core minimal and delegate features to extensions
- **Explicit APIs**: Clear, versioned interfaces for extension interactions
- **Lazy Loading**: Extensions load only when needed for optimal performance
- **Security First**: Extensions run with appropriate permissions and sandboxing

Learn more in our [Architecture Documentation](./architecture/overview).

## Current Status

The extension architecture is currently in active development. The initial focus is on SQL Lab extensions, with plans to expand to:

- Dashboard extensions
- Chart plugins (enhanced from current system)
- Database connectors
- Security providers

## Example: Dataset References Extension

See the extension system in action with our Dataset References example, which adds a SQL Lab panel showing:

- Tables referenced in queries
- Table owners for permission requests  
- Last available partitions
- Estimated row counts

## Join the Community

- **Contribute**: Help shape the future of Superset extensions
- **Share**: Publish your extensions for others to use
- **Learn**: Explore extensions built by the community

*The Superset extension architecture is inspired by the successful model of VS Code Extensions, bringing similar flexibility and power to the data exploration domain.*
