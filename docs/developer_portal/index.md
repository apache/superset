# Superset Developer Portal

Welcome to the Superset Developer Portal. Here you'll find step-by-step guides to help you get the most out of Superset.

## Getting Started

If you're new to Superset, start with our [Getting Started](/developer_portal/getting-started) guides.

## What's in this section?

This Developer Portal section is versioned independently from the main documentation and the component library. This means:

1. We can update developer guides for new Superset versions without affecting documentation for older versions
2. We can maintain guides for multiple Superset versions simultaneously
3. Users can easily find guides relevant to their specific Superset version

Use the version dropdown in the navbar to switch between different versions of the Developer Portal.
