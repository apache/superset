# Superset Design System

A design system is a complete set of standards intended to manage design at scale using reusable components and patterns.

The Superset Design System uses [Atomic Design](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) principles with adapted terminology:

| Atomic Design | Atoms | Molecules | Organisms | Templates | Pages / Screens |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| **Superset Design** | Foundations | Components | Patterns | Templates | Features |

## Component Library

Interactive documentation for Superset's UI component library. **50 components** documented across 2 categories.

### [Core Components](./ui/)
43 components — Buttons, inputs, modals, selects, and other fundamental UI elements.

### [Layout Components](./design-system/)
7 components — Grid, Layout, Table, Flex, Space, and container components for page structure.


## Usage

All components are exported from `@superset-ui/core/components`:

```tsx
import { Button, Modal, Select } from '@superset-ui/core/components';
```

## Contributing

This documentation is auto-generated from Storybook stories. To add or update component documentation:

1. Create or update the component's `.stories.tsx` file
2. Add a descriptive `title` and `description` in the story meta
3. Export an interactive story with `args` for configurable props
4. Run `yarn generate:superset-components` in the `docs/` directory

:::info Work in Progress
This component library is actively being documented. See the [Components TODO](./TODO) page for a list of components awaiting documentation.
