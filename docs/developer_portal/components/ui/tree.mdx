# Tree

The Tree component is used to display hierarchical data in a tree structure. It allows for features such as selection, expansion, and drag-and-drop functionality.

## Live Example

<StoryWithControls
  component="Tree"
  props={{
  checkable: false,
  defaultExpandAll: false,
  disabled: false,
  draggable: false,
  multiple: false,
  selectable: true,
  showIcon: false,
  showLine: false
}}
  controls={[
  {
    name: "checkable",
    label: "Checkable",
    type: "boolean",
    description: "Add a Checkbox before the treeNodes"
  },
  {
    name: "defaultExpandAll",
    label: "Default Expand All",
    type: "boolean",
    description: "Whether to expand all treeNodes by default"
  },
  {
    name: "disabled",
    label: "Disabled",
    type: "boolean",
    description: "Whether disabled the tree"
  },
  {
    name: "draggable",
    label: "Draggable",
    type: "boolean",
    description: "Specifies whether this Tree or the node is draggable"
  },
  {
    name: "multiple",
    label: "Multiple",
    type: "boolean",
    description: "Allows selecting multiple treeNodes"
  },
  {
    name: "selectable",
    label: "Selectable",
    type: "boolean",
    description: "Whether can be selected"
  },
  {
    name: "showIcon",
    label: "Show Icon",
    type: "boolean",
    description: "Controls whether to display the icon node"
  },
  {
    name: "showLine",
    label: "Show Line",
