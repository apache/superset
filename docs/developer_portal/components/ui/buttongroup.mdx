# ButtonGroup

ButtonGroup is a container that groups multiple Button components together with consistent spacing and styling.

## Live Example

<StoryWithControls
  component="ButtonGroup"
  props={{
  expand: false
}}
  controls={[
  {
    name: "expand",
    label: "Expand",
    type: "boolean",
    description: "When true, buttons expand to fill available width."
  },
  {
    name: "className",
    label: "Class Name",
    type: "text",
    description: "CSS class name for custom styling."
  }
]}
  sampleChildren={[{"component":"Button","props":{"buttonStyle":"tertiary","children":"Button 1"}},{"component":"Button","props":{"buttonStyle":"tertiary","children":"Button 2"}},{"component":"Button","props":{"buttonStyle":"tertiary","children":"Button 3"}}]}
/>

## Try It

    <ButtonGroup>
      <Button buttonStyle="tertiary">Button 1</Button>
      <Button buttonStyle="tertiary">Button 2</Button>
      <Button buttonStyle="tertiary">Button 3</Button>
    </ButtonGroup>
