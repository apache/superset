# IconButton

The IconButton component is a versatile button that allows you to combine an icon with a text label. It is designed for use in situations where you want to display an icon along with some text in a single clickable element.

## Live Example

<StoryWithControls
  component="IconButton"
  props={{}}
  controls={[
  {
    name: "altText",
    label: "Alt Text",
    type: "text",
    description: "The alt text for the button. If not provided, the button text is used as the alt text by default."
  },
  {
    name: "buttonText",
    label: "Button Text",
    type: "text",
    description: "The text inside the button"
  },
  {
    name: "padded",
    label: "Padded",
    type: "boolean",
    description: "add padding between icon and button text"
  }
]}
/>
