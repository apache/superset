# Python Guidelines

üöß **Coming Soon** üöß

Python coding standards for Superset backend development.

## Topics to be covered:

- PEP 8 compliance
- Type hints requirements
- MyPy configuration
- Black formatter settings
- Import organization
- Docstring standards
- Error handling patterns
- Async/await usage
- SQLAlchemy best practices
- Flask patterns

## Key Requirements

1. **Type hints required** - All new code needs type annotations
2. **MyPy compliant** - Must pass `pre-commit run mypy`
3. **Black formatted** - Use Black for consistent formatting
4. **Comprehensive docstrings** - All public functions/classes
5. **SQLAlchemy typing** - Proper model annotations

## Quick Examples

```python
# ‚úÖ Good - with type hints
def calculate_total(items: list[float]) -> float:
    """Calculate the sum of all items.

    :param items: List of numeric values
    :return: Sum of all items
    """
    return sum(items)

# ‚ùå Bad - missing type hints
def calculate_total(items):
    return sum(items)
```
