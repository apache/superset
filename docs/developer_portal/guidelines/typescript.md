# TypeScript Guidelines

üöß **Coming Soon** üöß

TypeScript-specific coding standards for Superset frontend development.

## Topics to be covered:

- TypeScript configuration
- Type definitions best practices
- Avoiding `any` types
- Interface vs Type aliases
- Generic types usage
- Utility types
- Strict mode compliance
- Module imports/exports
- Async/await patterns
- Error handling in TypeScript

## Key Rules

1. **No `any` types** - Use proper TypeScript types
2. **Prefer interfaces** for object shapes
3. **Use enums** for fixed sets of values
4. **Enable strict mode** in tsconfig
5. **Export types separately** from implementations

## Quick Examples

```typescript
// ‚ùå Bad
const data: any = fetchData();

// ‚úÖ Good
interface DataResponse {
  id: number;
  name: string;
}
const data: DataResponse = fetchData();
```
