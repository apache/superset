# React Guidelines

ðŸš§ **Coming Soon** ðŸš§

React and component development best practices for Superset.

## Topics to be covered:

- Functional components with hooks
- Component organization
- State management patterns
- Props validation with TypeScript
- Custom hooks guidelines
- Performance optimization
- Memoization strategies
- Testing React components
- Styling with Emotion
- Accessibility requirements

## Key Principles

1. **Functional components only** - No class components
2. **Hooks for state** - useState, useEffect, custom hooks
3. **TypeScript for props** - No PropTypes
4. **Emotion for styling** - Avoid inline styles
5. **Test with RTL** - React Testing Library, not Enzyme
