# Extension Host Architecture

=§ **Coming Soon** =§

Deep dive into Superset's extension host system and how plugins are loaded, managed, and executed.

## Topics to be covered:

- Extension host lifecycle and management
- Plugin loading and initialization process
- Sandboxing and security isolation
- Inter-plugin communication protocols
- Resource management and cleanup
- Plugin dependency resolution
- Hot reloading and development workflows
- Error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Performance monitoring and profiling
- Extension host configuration and tuning

## Extension Host Components

### Core Services
- **Plugin Registry** - Central plugin management
- **Dependency Injector** - Service composition and lifecycle
- **Event Bus** - Cross-plugin communication
- **Resource Manager** - Memory and asset management
- **Security Manager** - Permission and isolation enforcement

### Plugin Lifecycle Management
- **Discovery phase** - Plugin detection and validation
- **Loading phase** - Asset loading and module resolution
- **Initialization phase** - Plugin setup and registration
- **Activation phase** - Feature enablement and integration
- **Deactivation phase** - Graceful shutdown and cleanup

### Communication Patterns
- **Message passing** - Async communication between plugins
- **Shared state** - Controlled state sharing mechanisms
- **Event broadcasting** - System-wide event notifications
- **Service injection** - Dependency provision and consumption

## Advanced Features

### Plugin Isolation
- JavaScript sandbox environments
- CSS isolation and scoping
- Resource quota management
- Error boundary implementation

### Development Tools
- Hot reloading capabilities
- Debug mode and logging
- Performance profiling tools
- Plugin inspector interfaces
