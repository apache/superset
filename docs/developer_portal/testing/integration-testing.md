# Integration Testing

=� **Coming Soon** =�

Test how your plugin components work together and integrate with Superset's core functionality.

## Topics to be covered:

- Integration testing strategy and scope
- Testing plugin lifecycle and registration
- API integration testing with mock servers
- Testing data flow between components
- Plugin configuration testing
- Testing plugin interactions with core Superset
- Database integration testing
- Authentication and authorization testing
- Performance integration testing
- Error handling in integrated systems

## Integration Test Types

### Plugin Lifecycle Testing
- **Registration testing** - Plugin loading and initialization
- **Activation testing** - Plugin feature activation
- **Deactivation testing** - Graceful plugin shutdown
- **Update testing** - Plugin version migration
- **Cleanup testing** - Resource cleanup on uninstall

### API Integration Testing
- **REST API testing** - HTTP request/response validation
- **WebSocket testing** - Real-time communication
- **Authentication flows** - Login and session management
- **Error response handling** - API error scenarios
- **Rate limiting** - API throttling behavior

### Data Integration Testing
