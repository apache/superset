# Testing Overview

Apache Superset follows a comprehensive testing strategy that ensures code quality, reliability, and maintainability. This section covers all aspects of testing in the Superset ecosystem, from unit tests to end-to-end testing workflows.

## Testing Philosophy

Superset embraces a testing pyramid approach:

- **Unit Tests**: Fast, isolated tests for individual components and functions
- **Integration Tests**: Tests that verify component interactions and API endpoints
- **End-to-End Tests**: Full user journey testing in browser environments

## Testing Documentation

### Frontend Testing
- **[Frontend Testing](./frontend-testing)** - Jest, React Testing Library, and component testing strategies

### Backend Testing  
- **[Backend Testing](./backend-testing)** - pytest, database testing, and API testing patterns

### End-to-End Testing
- **[E2E Testing](./e2e-testing)** - Playwright testing for complete user workflows

### CI/CD Integration
- **[CI/CD](./ci-cd)** - Continuous integration, automated testing, and deployment pipelines

## Testing Tools & Frameworks

### Frontend
- **Jest**: JavaScript testing framework for unit and integration tests
- **React Testing Library**: Component testing utilities focused on user behavior
- **Playwright**: Modern end-to-end testing for web applications
- **Storybook**: Component development and visual testing environment

### Backend
- **pytest**: Python testing framework with powerful fixtures and plugins
- **SQLAlchemy Test Utilities**: Database testing and transaction management
- **Flask Test Client**: API endpoint testing and request simulation
- **Factory Boy**: Test data generation and model factories

## Best Practices

### Writing Effective Tests
1. **Test Behavior, Not Implementation**: Focus on what the code should do, not how it does it
2. **Keep Tests Independent**: Each test should be able to run in isolation
3. **Use Descriptive Names**: Test names should clearly describe what is being tested
4. **Arrange, Act, Assert**: Structure tests with clear setup, execution, and verification phases

### Test Organization
- **Colocation**: Place test files near the code they test
- **Naming Conventions**: Use consistent naming patterns for test files and functions
- **Test Categories**: Organize tests by type (unit, integration, e2e)
- **Test Data Management**: Use factories and fixtures for consistent test data

## Running Tests

### Quick Commands
```bash
# Frontend unit tests
npm run test

# Backend unit tests  
pytest tests/unit_tests/

# End-to-end tests
npm run playwright:test

# All tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

### Test Development Workflow
1. **Write Failing Test**: Start with a test that describes the desired behavior
2. **Implement Feature**: Write the minimum code to make the test pass
3. **Refactor**: Improve code quality while keeping tests green
4. **Verify Coverage**: Ensure adequate test coverage for new code

## Testing in Development

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- Write tests before implementation
- Use tests to guide design decisions
- Maintain fast feedback loops

### Continuous Testing
- Run tests automatically on code changes
- Integrate testing into development workflow
- Use pre-commit hooks for test validation

## Getting Started

1. **Set up Testing Environment**: Follow the development setup guide
2. **Run Existing Tests**: Familiarize yourself with the test suite
3. **Write Your First Test**: Start with a simple unit test
4. **Learn Testing Patterns**: Study existing tests for patterns and conventions

## Topics to be covered:

- Testing strategy and pyramid
- Test-driven development (TDD) for plugins
- Continuous integration and automated testing
- Code coverage and quality metrics
- Testing tools and frameworks overview
- Mock data and test fixtures
- Performance testing and benchmarking
- Accessibility testing automation
- Cross-browser and device testing
- Regression testing strategies

## Testing Levels

### Unit Testing
- **Component testing** - Individual React components
- **Function testing** - Data transformation and utility functions
- **Hook testing** - Custom React hooks
- **Service testing** - API clients and business logic

### Integration Testing
- **API integration** - Backend service communication
- **Component integration** - Multi-component workflows
- **Data flow testing** - End-to-end data processing
- **Plugin lifecycle testing** - Installation and activation

### End-to-End Testing
- **User workflow testing** - Complete user journeys
- **Cross-browser testing** - Browser compatibility
- **Performance testing** - Load and stress testing
- **Accessibility testing** - Screen reader and keyboard navigation

## Testing Tools

- **Jest** - Unit and integration testing framework
- **React Testing Library** - Component testing utilities
- **Playwright** - End-to-end testing (replacing Cypress)
- **Storybook** - Component development and testing
- **MSW** - API mocking for testing
