# Unit Testing

ðŸš§ **Coming Soon** ðŸš§

Learn how to write effective unit tests for your Superset plugin components, functions, and services.

## Topics to be covered:

- Jest testing framework setup and configuration
- React Testing Library best practices
- Testing React components and hooks
- Mocking dependencies and external services
- Testing data transformation functions
- Snapshot testing for component output
- Test-driven development workflow
- Code coverage analysis and reporting
- Testing asynchronous operations
- Testing error handling and edge cases

## Testing Patterns

### Component Testing
- **Rendering tests** - Verify component renders without errors
- **Props testing** - Test component behavior with different props
- **Event handling** - Test user interactions and callbacks
- **State management** - Test component state changes
- **Conditional rendering** - Test different UI states

### Function Testing
- **Pure function testing** - Input/output validation
- **Data transformation** - Test chart data processing
- **Utility functions** - Helper function validation
- **Error scenarios** - Exception handling tests
- **Edge cases** - Boundary condition testing

### Hook Testing
- **Custom hook behavior** - State and effect testing
- **Hook dependencies** - Testing hook interactions
- **Cleanup testing** - Effect cleanup validation
- **Performance testing** - Hook optimization verification

## Testing Utilities

### Superset Test Helpers
- **Custom render functions** - Pre-configured component rendering
- **Mock data generators** - Realistic test data creation
- **Theme providers** - Testing with different themes
- **Store providers** - Redux store testing setup

### Jest Configuration
- Test environment setup
- Module mocking strategies
- Custom matchers and assertions
- Test file organization
