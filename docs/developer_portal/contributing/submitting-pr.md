## Before You Start

### Prerequisites
- [ ] Development environment is set up
- [ ] You've forked and cloned the repository
- [ ] You've read the [contributing overview](./overview)
- [ ] You've found or created an issue to work on

### PR Readiness Checklist
- [ ] Code follows [coding guidelines](../coding-guidelines/overview)
- [ ] Tests are passing locally
- [ ] Linting passes (`pre-commit run --all-files`)

## Creating Your Pull Request

### 1. Create a Feature Branch

```bash
# Update your fork
git fetch upstream
git checkout master
git merge upstream/master
git push origin master

# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### 2. Make Your Changes

```bash
# Make changes
edit files...

# Run tests
pytest tests/unit_tests/
cd superset-frontend && npm run test

# Run linting
pre-commit run --all-files

# Commit with conventional format
git add .
git commit -m "feat(dashboard): add new filter component"
```

### 3. PR Title Format

Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
type(scope): description
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only
- `style`: Code style (formatting, semicolons, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `perf`: Performance improvement
- `test`: Adding tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks
- `ci`: CI/CD changes
- `build`: Build system changes
- `revert`: Reverting changes

**Scopes:**
- `dashboard`: Dashboard functionality
- `sqllab`: SQL Lab features
- `explore`: Chart explorer
- `chart`: Visualization components
- `api`: REST API endpoints
- `db`: Database connections
- `security`: Security features
- `config`: Configuration

**Examples:**
```
feat(sqllab): add query cost estimation
fix(dashboard): resolve filter cascading issue
docs(api): update REST endpoint documentation
refactor(explore): simplify chart controls logic
perf(dashboard): optimize chart loading
```

### 4. PR Description Template

Use the template from `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`:

```markdown
### SUMMARY
Brief description of changes and motivation.

### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF
[Required for UI changes]

### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS
1. Step-by-step instructions
2. How to verify the fix/feature
3. Any specific test scenarios

### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
- [ ] Has associated issue: #12345
- [ ] Required feature flags:
- [ ] API changes:
- [ ] DB migration required:

### CHECKLIST
- [ ] CI checks pass
- [ ] Tests added/updated
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] PR title follows conventions
```

### 5. Submit the PR

```bash
# Push to your fork
git push origin feature/your-feature-name

# Create PR via GitHub CLI
gh pr create --title "feat(sqllab): add query cost estimation" \
  --body-file .github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md

# Or use the GitHub web interface
```

## PR Best Practices

### Keep PRs Focused
- One feature/fix per PR
- Break large changes into smaller PRs
- Separate refactoring from feature changes

### Write Good Commit Messages
```bash
# Good
git commit -m "fix(dashboard): prevent duplicate API calls when filters change"

# Bad
git commit -m "fix bug"
git commit -m "updates"
```

### Include Tests
```python
# Backend test example
def test_new_feature():
    """Test that new feature works correctly."""
    result = new_feature_function()
    assert result == expected_value
```

```typescript
// Frontend test example
test('renders new component', () => {
  const { getByText } = render(<NewComponent />);
  expect(getByText('Expected Text')).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

### Add Screenshots for UI Changes
```markdown
### Before
![Before](link-to-before-screenshot)

### After  
![After](link-to-after-screenshot)
```

### Update Documentation
- Update relevant docs in `/docs` directory
- Add docstrings to new functions/classes
- Update UPDATING.md for breaking changes

## CI Checks

### Required Checks
All PRs must pass:
- `Python Tests` - Backend unit/integration tests
- `Frontend Tests` - JavaScript/TypeScript tests
- `Linting` - Code style checks
- `Type Checking` - MyPy and TypeScript
- `License Check` - Apache license headers
- `Documentation Build` - Docs compile successfully

### Common CI Failures

#### Python Test Failures
```bash
# Run locally to debug
pytest tests/unit_tests/ -v
pytest tests/integration_tests/ -v
```

#### Frontend Test Failures
```bash
cd superset-frontend
npm run test -- --coverage
```

#### Linting Failures
```bash
# Auto-fix many issues
pre-commit run --all-files

# Manual fixes may be needed for:
# - MyPy type errors
# - Complex ESLint issues
# - License headers
```

## Responding to Reviews

### Address Feedback Promptly
```bash
# Make requested changes
edit files...

# Add commits (don't amend during review)
git add .
git commit -m "fix: address review feedback"
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### Request Re-review
- Click "Re-request review" after addressing feedback
- Comment on resolved discussions
- Thank reviewers for their time

### Handling Conflicts
```bash
# Update your branch
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/master

# Resolve conflicts
edit conflicted files...
git add .
git rebase --continue

# Force push (only to your feature branch!)
git push --force-with-lease origin feature/your-feature-name
```

## After Merge

### Clean Up
```bash
# Delete local branch
git checkout master
git branch -d feature/your-feature-name

# Delete remote branch
git push origin --delete feature/your-feature-name

# Update your fork
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/master
git push origin master
```
