# Code Review Process

Understand how code reviews work in Apache Superset and how to participate effectively.

## Overview

Code review is a critical part of maintaining code quality and sharing knowledge across the team. Every change to Superset goes through peer review before merging.

## For Authors

### Preparing for Review

#### Before Requesting Review
- [ ] Self-review your changes
- [ ] Ensure CI checks pass
- [ ] Add comprehensive tests
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Fill out PR template completely
- [ ] Add screenshots for UI changes

#### Self-Review Checklist
```bash
# View your changes
git diff upstream/master

# Check for common issues:
# - Commented out code
# - Debug statements (console.log, print)
# - TODO comments that should be addressed
# - Hardcoded values that should be configurable
# - Missing error handling
# - Performance implications
```

### Requesting Review

#### Auto-Assignment
GitHub will automatically request reviews based on CODEOWNERS file.

#### Manual Assignment
For specific expertise, request additional reviewers:
- Frontend changes: Tag frontend experts
- Backend changes: Tag backend experts
- Security changes: Tag security team
- Database changes: Tag database experts

#### Review Request Message
```markdown
@reviewer This PR implements [feature]. Could you please review:
1. The approach taken in [file]
2. Performance implications of [change]
3. Security considerations for [feature]

Thanks!
```

### Responding to Feedback

#### Best Practices
- **Be receptive**: Reviews improve code quality
- **Ask questions**: Clarify if feedback is unclear
- **Explain decisions**: Share context for your choices
- **Update promptly**: Address feedback in timely manner

#### Comment Responses
```markdown
# Acknowledging
"Good catch! Fixed in [commit hash]"

# Explaining
"I chose this approach because [reason]. Would you prefer [alternative]?"

# Questioning
"Could you elaborate on [concern]? I'm not sure I understand the issue."

# Disagreeing respectfully
"I see your point, but I think [current approach] because [reason]. What do you think?"
```

## For Reviewers

### Providing Feedback

#### Effective Comments

```python
# ‚úÖ Good: Specific and actionable
"This query could cause N+1 problems. Consider using
`select_related('user')` to fetch users in a single query."

# ‚ùå Bad: Vague
"This doesn't look right."
```

```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good: Suggests improvement
"Consider using useMemo here to prevent unnecessary
re-renders when dependencies haven't changed."

// ‚ùå Bad: Just criticism
"This is inefficient."
```

#### Comment Types

**Use GitHub's comment types:**
- **Comment**: General feedback or questions
- **Approve**: Changes look good
- **Request Changes**: Must be addressed before merge

**Prefix conventions:**
- `nit:` Minor issue (non-blocking)
- `suggestion:` Recommended improvement
- `question:` Seeking clarification
- `blocker:` Must be fixed
- `praise:` Highlighting good work

#### Examples

```markdown
nit: Consider renaming `getData` to `fetchUserData` for clarity

suggestion: This could be simplified using Array.reduce()

question: Is this intentionally not handling the error case?

blocker: This SQL is vulnerable to injection. Please use parameterized queries.

praise: Excellent test coverage! üëç
```

## Becoming a Reviewer

### Path to Reviewer
1. **Contribute regularly**: Submit quality PRs
2. **Participate in discussions**: Share knowledge
3. **Review others' code**: Start with comments
4. **Build expertise**: Focus on specific areas
5. **Get nominated**: By existing committers

### Reviewer Expectations
- Review PRs in your area of expertise
- Respond within reasonable time
- Mentor new contributors
- Maintain high standards
- Stay current with best practices

## Advanced Topics

### Reviewing Large PRs

#### Strategy
1. **Request splitting**: Ask to break into smaller PRs
2. **Review in phases**:
   - Architecture/approach first
   - Implementation details second
   - Tests and docs last
3. **Use draft reviews**: Save comments and submit together

### Cross-Team Reviews

#### When Needed
- Changes affecting multiple teams
- Shared components/libraries
- API contract changes
- Database schema changes

### Performance Reviews

#### Tools
```python
# Backend performance
import cProfile
import pstats

# Profile the code
cProfile.run('function_to_profile()', 'stats.prof')
stats = pstats.Stats('stats.prof')
stats.sort_stats('cumulative').print_stats(10)
```

```typescript
// Frontend performance
// Use React DevTools Profiler
// Chrome DevTools Performance tab
// Lighthouse audits
```
