# Extension Components

These UI components are available to Superset extension developers through the `@apache-superset/core/ui` package. They provide a consistent look and feel with the rest of Superset and are designed to be used in extension panels, views, and other UI elements.

## Available Components

- [Alert](./alert)

## Usage

All components are exported from the `@apache-superset/core/ui` package:

```tsx
import { Alert } from '@apache-superset/core/ui';

export function MyExtensionPanel() {
  return (
    <Alert type="info">
      Welcome to my extension!
    </Alert>
  );
}
```

## Adding New Components

Components in `@apache-superset/core/ui` are automatically documented here. To add a new extension component:

1. Add the component to `superset-frontend/packages/superset-core/src/ui/components/`
2. Export it from `superset-frontend/packages/superset-core/src/ui/components/index.ts`
3. Create a Storybook story with an `Interactive` export:

```tsx
export default {
  title: 'Extension Components/MyComponent',
  component: MyComponent,
  parameters: {
    docs: {
      description: {
        component: 'Description of the component...',
      },
    },
  },
};

export const InteractiveMyComponent = (args) => <MyComponent {...args} />;

InteractiveMyComponent.args = {
  variant: 'primary',
  disabled: false,
};

InteractiveMyComponent.argTypes = {
  variant: {
    control: { type: 'select' },
    options: ['primary', 'secondary'],
  },
  disabled: {
    control: { type: 'boolean' },
  },
};
```

4. Run `yarn start` in `docs/` - the page generates automatically!
