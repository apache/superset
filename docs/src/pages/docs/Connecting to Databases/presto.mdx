## Presto

The [pyhive](https://pypi.org/project/PyHive/) library is the recommended way to connect to Presto through SQLAlchemy.

The expected connection string is formatted as follows:

```
hive://hive@{hostname}:{port}/{database}
```

By default Superset assumes the most recent version of Presto is being used when querying the
datasource. If you’re using an older version of Presto, you can configure it in the extra parameter:

```
{
    "version": "0.123"
}
```
