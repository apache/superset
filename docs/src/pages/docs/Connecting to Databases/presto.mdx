## Presto

The connector library [pyhive](https://pypi.org/project/PyHive/) comes with Superset out of the box.
This is the recommended way to connect to Presto.

The expected connection string is formatted as follows:

```
hive://hive@{hostname}:{port}/{database}
```

By default Superset assumes the most recent version of Presto is being used when querying the
datasource. If you’re using an older version of Presto, you can configure it in the extra parameter:

```
{
    "version": "0.123"
}
```
