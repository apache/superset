## Presto

The [pyhive](https://pypi.org/project/PyHive/) library is the recommended way to connect to Presto through SQLAlchemy.

The expected connection string is formatted as follows:

```
presto://{hostname}:{port}/{database}
e.g.
presto://presto.example.com:8080/hive
```

By default Superset assumes the most recent version of Presto is being used when querying the
datasource. If youâ€™re using an older version of Presto, you can configure it in the extra parameter:

```
{
    "version": "0.123"
}
```
