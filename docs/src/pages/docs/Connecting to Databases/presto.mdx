## Presto

The [pyhive](https://pypi.org/project/PyHive/) library is the recommended way to connect to Presto through SQLAlchemy.

The expected connection string is formatted as follows:

```
presto://{hostname}:{port}/{database}
```

You can pass in a username and password as well:

```
presto://{username}:{password}@{hostname}:{port}/{database}
```

Here is an example connection string with values:

```
presto://datascientist:securepassword@presto.example.com:8080/hive
```

By default Superset assumes the most recent version of Presto is being used when querying the
datasource. If you’re using an older version of Presto, you can configure it in the extra parameter:


```
{
    "version": "0.123"
}
```
