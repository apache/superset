## Google Sheets

Google Sheets has a very limited
[SQL API](https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/querylanguage). The recommended
connector library for Google Sheets is [gsheetsdb](https://github.com/betodealmeida/gsheets-db-api).

There are a few steps involved in connecting Superset to Google Sheets. This
[tutorial](https://preset.io/blog/2020-06-01-connect-superset-google-sheets/) has the most upto date
instructions on setting up this connection.
