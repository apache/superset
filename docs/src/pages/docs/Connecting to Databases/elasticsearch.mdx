## Elasticsearch

The recommended connector library for Elasticsearch is
[elasticsearch-dbapi](https://github.com/preset-io/elasticsearch-dbapi).

The connection string for Elasticsearch looks like this:

```
elasticsearch+http://{user}:{password}@{host}:9200/
```

**Using HTTPS**

```
elasticsearch+https://{user}:{password}@{host}:9200/
```

Elasticsearch as a default limit of 10000 rows, so you can increase this limit on your cluster or
set Supersetâ€™s row limit on config

```
ROW_LIMIT = 10000
```

You can query multiple indices on SQL Lab for example

```
SELECT timestamp, agent FROM "logstash"
```

But, to use visualizations for multiple indices you need to create an alias index on your cluster

```
POST /_aliases
{
    "actions" : [
        { "add" : { "index" : "logstash-**", "alias" : "logstash_all" } }
    ]
}
```

Then register your table with the alias name logstasg_all
