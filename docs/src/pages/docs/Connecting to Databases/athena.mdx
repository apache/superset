## AWS Athena

### PyAthenaJDBC

[PyAthenaJDBC](https://pypi.org/project/PyAthenaJDBC/) is a Python DB 2.0 compliant wrapper for the
[Amazon Athena JDBC driver](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/connect-with-jdbc.html).

The connection string for Amazon Athena is as follows:

```
awsathena+jdbc://{aws_access_key_id}:{aws_secret_access_key}@athena.{region_name}.amazonaws.com/{schema_name}?s3_staging_dir={s3_staging_dir}&...
```

Note that you'll need to escape & encode when forming the connection string like so:

```
s3://... -> s3%3A//...
```

### PyAthena

You can also use [PyAthena library](https://pypi.org/project/PyAthena/) (no Java required) with the
following connection string:

```
awsathena+rest://{aws_access_key_id}:{aws_secret_access_key}@athena.{region_name}.amazonaws.com/{
```
