## CrateDB

The recommended connector library for CrateDB is
[crate](https://pypi.org/project/crate/).
You need to install the extras as well for this library.
We recommend adding something like the following
text to your requirements file:

```
crate[sqlalchemy]==0.26.0
```

The expected connection string is formatted as follows:

```
crate://crate@127.0.0.1:4200
```
