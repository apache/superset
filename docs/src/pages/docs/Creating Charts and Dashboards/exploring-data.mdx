## Exploring Data in Superset

In this tutorial, we will introduce key concepts in Apache Superset through the exploration of a
real dataset which contains the flights made by employees of a UK-based organization in 2011. The
following information about each flight is given:

- The traveller’s department. For the purposes of this tutorial the departments have been renamed
  Orange, Yellow and Purple.
- The cost of the ticket.
- The travel class (Economy, Premium Economy, Business and First Class).
- Whether the ticket was a single or return.
- The date of travel.
- Information about the origin and destination.
- The distance between the origin and destination, in kilometers (km).

### Enabling Data Upload Functionality

You may need to enable the functionality to upload a CSV, Excel file or Parquet file to your database. The following section
explains how to enable this functionality for the examples database.

**Note:** To enable `Upload Excel`, you need to make sure that the `xlrd` dependency is installed,
which you can execute `pip install apache-superset[excel]` to install.

In the top menu, select **Data ‣ Databases**. Find the **examples** database in the list and
select the **Edit** button.

<img src="/images/edit-record.png" />

In the resulting modal window, switch to the **Advanced** tab and
expand the **Security** section. Tick the checkbox for **Allow Data Upload**.
End by clicking the **Save** button.

<img src="/images/db-modal-advanced.png" />
<img src="/images/add-data-upload.png" />

### Loading CSV Data

Download the CSV dataset to your computer from
[Github](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache-superset/examples-data/master/tutorial_flights.csv).
In the Superset menu, select **Data ‣ Upload a CSV**.

<img src="/images/upload_a_csv.png" />

Then, enter the **Table Name** as _tutorial_flights_ and select the CSV file from your computer.

<img src="/images/csv_to_database_configuration.png" />

Next enter the text _Travel Date_ into the **Parse Dates** field.

<img src="/images/parse_dates_column.png" />

Leaving all the other options in their default settings, select **Save** at the bottom of the page.

### Table Visualization

You should now see _tutorial_flights_ as a dataset in the **Datasets** tab. Click on the entry to
launch an Explore workflow using this dataset.

First, we want to specify the rows in our table by using the **Group by** option. Since in this
example, we want to understand different Travel Classes, we select **Travel Class** in this menu.

Next, we can specify the metrics we would like to see in our table with the **Metrics** option.

- `COUNT(*)`, which represents the number of rows in the table
(in this case, quantity of flights in each Travel Class)
- `SUM(Cost)`, which represents the total cost spent by each Travel Class

<img src="/images/count_column.png" />
<img src="/images/sum_cost_column.png" />

Finally, select **Run Query** to see the results of the table.

<img src="/images/tutorial_table.png" />

To save the visualization, click on **Save** in the top left of the screen. In the following modal,

- Select the **Save as**
option and enter the chart name as Tutorial Table (you will be able to find it again through the
**Charts** screen, accessible in the top menu).
- Select **Add To Dashboard** and enter
Tutorial Dashboard. Finally, select **Save & Go To Dashboard**.

<img src="/images/save_tutorial_table.png" />

### Dashboard Basics

Next, we are going to explore the dashboard interface. If you’ve followed the previous section, you
should already have the dashboard open. Otherwise, you can navigate to the dashboard by selecting
Dashboards on the top menu, then Tutorial dashboard from the list of dashboards.

On this dashboard you should see the table you created in the previous section. Select **Edit
dashboard** and then hover over the table. By selecting the bottom right hand corner of the table
(the cursor will change too), you can resize it by dragging and dropping.

<img src="/images/resize_tutorial_table_on_dashboard.png" />

Finally, save your changes by selecting Save changes in the top right.

### Pivot Table v2

In this section, we will extend our analysis using a more complex visualization, Pivot Table v2. By the
end of this section, you will have created a table that shows the monthly spend on flights for the
first six months, by department, by travel class.

Create a new chart by selecting **+ ‣ Chart** from the top right corner. Choose
tutorial_flights again as a datasource, then click on the visualization type to get to the
visualization menu. Select the **Pivot Table v2** visualization (you can filter by entering text in the
search box) and then **Create New Chart**.

<img src="/images/create_pivot_2.png" />

In the **Time** section, keep the Time Column as Travel Date (this is selected automatically, as we
only have one time column in our dataset). Then select Time Grain to be month as having daily data
would be too granular to see patterns from. Then select the Time Range to be the first six months of
2011 by clicking into the Time Range edit menu, selecting Custom from the Range Type dropdown,
and selecting a Start / end of 1st January 2011 and 30th June 2011 respectively by either entering
the dates directly or using the calendar widget (by selecting the month name and then the year, you
can move more quickly to far away dates).

<img src="/images/select_dates_pivot_table_v2.png" />

Next, within the **Query** section, add a SUM(Cost) metric. Note that Apache Superset will indicate
the type of the metric by the symbol on the left hand column of the list (ABC for string, # for
number, a clock face for time, etc.).

In **Rows** select **Travel Date**: this will automatically use the Time Column and Time Grain
selections we defined in the Time section.

Within **Columns**, select first Department and then Travel Class.

Under **Options**, tick the Show Rows Total and Show Columns Total checkboxes. All set – let’s
**Run Query** to see some data!

<img src="/images/tutorial_pivot_table_v2.png" />

You should see months in the rows and Department and Travel Class in the columns. Publish this chart
to your existing Tutorial Dashboard you created earlier.

### Line Chart

In this section, we are going to create a line chart to understand the average price of a ticket by
month across the entire dataset.

In the Time section, as before, keep the Time Column as Travel Date and Time Grain as month but this
time for the Time range select No filter as we want to look at entire dataset.

Within Metrics, remove the default `COUNT(*)` metric and instead add `AVG(Cost)`, to show the mean value.

<img src="/images/average_aggregate_for_cost.png" />

Next, select **Run Query** to show the data on the chart.

How does this look? Well, we can see that the average cost goes up in December. However, perhaps it
doesn’t make sense to combine both single and return tickets, but rather show two separate lines for
each ticket type.

Let’s do this by selecting Ticket Single or Return in the Group by box, and the selecting **Run
Query** again. Nice! We can see that on average single tickets are cheaper than returns and that the
big spike in December is caused by return tickets.

Our chart is looking pretty good already, but let’s customize some more by going to the Customize
tab on the left hand pane. Within this pane, try changing the Color Scheme, removing the range
filter by selecting No in the Show Range Filter drop down and adding some labels using X Axis Label
and Y Axis Label.

<img src="/images/tutorial_line_chart.png" />

Once you’re done, publish the chart in your Tutorial Dashboard.

### Markup

In this section, we will add some text to our dashboard. If you’re not there already, you can navigate
to the dashboard by selecting Dashboards on the top menu, then Tutorial dashboard from the list of
dashboards. Got into edit mode by selecting **Edit dashboard**.

Within the Insert components pane, drag and drop a Markdown box on the dashboard. Look for the blue
lines which indicate the anchor where the box will go.

<img src="/images/blue_bar_insert_component.png" />

Now, to edit the text, select the box. You can enter text, in markdown format (see
[this Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) for
more information about this format). You can toggle between Edit and Preview using the menu on the
top of the box.

<img src="/images/markdown.png" />

To exit, select any other part of the dashboard. Finally, don’t forget to keep your changes using
**Save changes**.

### Filter Box

In this section, you will learn how to add a filter to your dashboard. Specifically, we will create
a filter that allows us to look at those flights that depart from a particular country.

A filter box visualization can be created as any other visualization by selecting **+ ‣ Chart**,
and then _tutorial_flights_ as the datasource and Filter Box as the visualization type.

First of all, in the **Time** section, remove the filter from the Time range selection by selecting
No filter.

Next, in **Filters Configurations** first add a new filter by selecting the plus sign and then edit
the newly created filter by selecting the pencil icon.

For our use case, it makes most sense to present a list of countries in alphabetical order. First,
enter the column as Origin Country and keep all other options the same and then select **Run
Query**. This gives us a preview of our filter.

Next, remove the date filter by unchecking the Date Filter checkbox.

<img src="/images/filter_on_origin_country.png" />

Finally, select **Save**, name the chart as Tutorial Filter, add the chart to our existing Tutorial
Dashboard and then Save & go to dashboard. Once on the Dashboard, try using the filter to show only
those flights that departed from the United Kingdom – you will see the filter is applied to all of
the other visualizations on the dashboard.

### Native Filters

As Filter Box is set to be deprecated, this section will instruct you on how to use its replacement,
**Native Filters**. These are built into the dashboard view itself. Go to the Tutorial Dashboard and
select the filter icon in the top left corner:

<img src="/images/native_filters_menu_open.png" />

This will open the Native Filters panel, which is currently empty:

<img src="/images/native_filters_empty_panel.png" />

Click on the pencil icon to open up the **Filters Configuration** modal. From here, you can create new filters or
manage existing ones.

<img src="/images/native_filters_modal.png" />

We're going to create a numerical range for ticket cost:

- Select Numerical Range from the Filter Type dropdown
- Give the filter a name
- Select tutorial_flights from the Dataset dropdown if it's not been selected yet
- Select Cost from the Column dropdown

Click the **Save** button. Your filter will load in the panel.

<img src="/images/native_filters_num_range.png" />

You can adjust the slider to only include datapoints that fall within the selected range for Ticket
Cost! Set your range and click **Apply** to see how it affects your charts.

We can also recreate the Origin Country filter from the Filter Box section. In the **Filters
Configuration** modal, click the Add button in the bottom left and select Filter. Set your filter up as
follows:

- Select Value from Filter Type dropdown
- Select tutorial_flights from Dataset dropdown
- Select Origin Country from Column dropdown
- In Advanced, you can tick the Sort filter values checkbox to list country names alphabetically

**Save** your filters! You can now select origin countries to include from the resulting dropdown.

<img src="/images/native_filters_origin_country.png" />
<img src="/images/native_filters_origin_country_dropdown.png" />

### Publishing Your Dashboard

If you have followed all of the steps outlined in the previous section, you should have a dashboard
that looks like the below. If you would like, you can rearrange the elements of the dashboard by
selecting **Edit dashboard** and dragging and dropping.

If you would like to make your dashboard available to other users, simply select Draft next to the
title of your dashboard on the top left to change your dashboard to be in Published state. You can
also favorite this dashboard by selecting the star.

<img src="/images/publish_dashboard.png" />

### Annotations

Annotations allow you to add additional context to your chart. In this section, we will add an
annotation to the Tutorial Line Chart we made in a previous section. Specifically, we will add the
dates when some flights were cancelled by the UK’s Civil Aviation Authority in response to the
eruption of the Grímsvötn volcano in Iceland (23-25 May 2011).

First, add an annotation layer by navigating to Settings ‣ Manage ‣ Annotation Layers. Add a new annotation
layer by selecting the blue plus button to add a new record. Enter the name Volcanic Eruptions and
save. We can use this layer to refer to a number of different annotations.

Next, add an annotation by clicking into the newly created layer and then create a new annotation by
selecting the blue plus button. Then, select the Volcanic Eruptions layer, add a short description
Grímsvötn and the eruption dates (23-25 May 2011) before finally saving.

<img src="/images/edit_annotation.png" />

Then, navigate to the line chart by going to Charts then selecting Tutorial Line Chart from the
list. Next, go to the Annotations and Layers section and select Add Annotation Layer. Within this
dialogue:

- Name the layer as Volcanic Eruptions
- Change the Annotation Layer Type to Interval
- Set the Annotation Source as Superset annotation
- Specify the Annotation Layer as Volcanic Eruptions

<img src="/images/annotation_settings.png" />

Select **Apply** to see your annotation shown on the chart.

<img src="/images/annotation.png" />

If you wish, you can change how your annotation looks by changing the settings in the Display
configuration section. Otherwise, select **OK** and finally **Save** to save your chart. If you keep
the default selection to overwrite the chart, your annotation will be saved to the chart and also
appear automatically in the Tutorial Dashboard.

### Advanced Analytics

In this section, we are going to explore the Advanced Analytics feature of Apache Superset that
allows you to apply additional transformations to your data. The three types of transformation are:

**Setting up the base chart**

In this section, we’re going to set up a base chart which we can then apply the different **Advanced
Analytics** features to. Start off by creating a new chart using the same _tutorial_flights_
datasource and the **Line Chart** visualization type. Within the Time section, set the Time Range as
1st October 2011 and 31st October 2011.

Next, in the query section, change the Metrics to the sum of Cost. Select **Run Query** to show the
chart. You should see the total cost per day for each month in October 2011.

<img src="/images/advanced_analytics_base.png" />

Finally, save the visualization as Tutorial Advanced Analytics Base, adding it to the Tutorial
Dashboard.

### Rolling Mean

There is quite a lot of variation in the data, which makes it difficult to identify any trend. One
approach we can take is to show instead a rolling average of the time series. To do this, in the
**Rolling Window** subsection of **Advanced Analytics**, select mean in the **Rolling Function** box and
enter 7 into both Periods and Min Periods. The period is the length of the rolling period expressed
as a multiple of the Time Grain. In our example, the Time Grain is day, so the rolling period is 7
days, such that on the 7th October 2011 the value shown would correspond to the first seven days of
October 2011. Lastly, by specifying Min Periods as 7, we ensure that our mean is always calculated
on 7 days and we avoid any ramp up period.

After displaying the chart by selecting **Run Query** you will see that the data is less variable
and that the series starts later as the ramp up period is excluded.

<img src="/images/rolling_mean.png" />

Save the chart as Tutorial Rolling Mean and add it to the Tutorial Dashboard.

### Time Comparison

In this section, we will compare values in our time series to the value a week before. Start off by
opening the Tutorial Advanced Analytics Base chart, by going to **Charts** in the top menu and then
selecting the visualization name in the list (alternatively, find the chart in the Tutorial
Dashboard and select Explore chart from the menu for that visualization).

Next, in the Time Comparison subsection of **Advanced Analytics**, enter the Time Shift by typing in
“minus 1 week” (note this box accepts input in natural language). Run Query to see the new chart,
which has an additional series with the same values, shifted a week back in time.

<img src="/images/time_comparison_two_series.png" />

Then, change the **Calculation type** to Absolute difference and select **Run Query**. We can now
see only one series again, this time showing the difference between the two series we saw
previously.

<img src="/images/time_comparison_absolute_difference.png" />

Save the chart as Tutorial Time Comparison and add it to the Tutorial Dashboard.

### Resampling the data

In this section, we’ll resample the data so that rather than having daily data we have weekly data.
As in the previous section, reopen the Tutorial Advanced Analytics Base chart.

Next, in the Python Functions subsection of **Advanced Analytics**, enter 7D, corresponding to seven
days, in the Rule and median as the Method and show the chart by selecting **Run Query**.

<img src="/images/resample.png" />

Note that now we have a single data point every 7 days. In our case, the value showed corresponds to
the median value within the seven daily data points. For more information on the meaning of the
various options in this section, refer to the
[Pandas documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.resample.html).

Lastly, save your chart as Tutorial Resample and add it to the Tutorial Dashboard. Go to the
tutorial dashboard to see the four charts side by side and compare the different outputs.
