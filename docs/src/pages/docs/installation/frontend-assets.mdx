### Frontend

If you plan to make contributions to the superset frontend (contained within the `superset-frontend` folder in the main repo),
frontend assets (TypeScript, JavaScript, CSS, and images) must be compiled in order to properly display the web UI.
The `superset-frontend` directory contains all NPM-managed frontend assets.
Note that for some legacy pages there are additional frontend assets bundled with Flask-Appbuilder (e.g. jQuery and bootstrap).
These are not managed by NPM and may be phased out in the future.

#### Prerequisite

##### nvm and node

First, be sure you are using the following versions of Node.js and npm:

- `Node.js`: Version 16
- `npm`: Version 7

We recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage your node environment:

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.37.0/install.sh | bash

cd superset-frontend
nvm install --lts
nvm use --lts
```

Or if you use the default macOS starting with Catalina shell `zsh`, try:

```zsh
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.37.0/install.sh)"
```

For those interested, you may also try out [avn](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#deeper-shell-integration) to automatically
switch to the node version that is required to run Superset frontend.

#### Install dependencies

Install third-party dependencies listed in `package.json` via:

```bash
# From the root of the repository
cd superset-frontend

# Install dependencies from `package-lock.json`
npm ci
```

#### Build assets

There are three types of assets you can build:

1. `npm run build`: the production assets, CSS/JSS minified and optimized
2. `npm run dev-server`: local development assets, with sourcemaps and hot refresh support
3. `npm run build-instrumented`: instrumented application code for collecting code coverage from Cypress tests

#### Webpack dev server

The dev server by default starts at `http://localhost:9000` and proxies the backend requests to `http://localhost:8088`.
It's possible to change these settings:

```bash
# Start the dev server at http://localhost:9000
npm run dev-server

# Run the dev server on a non-default port
npm run dev-server -- --devserverPort=9001

# Proxy backend requests to a Flask server running on a non-default port
npm run dev-server -- --supersetPort=8081

# Proxy to a remote backend but serve local assets
npm run dev-server -- --superset=https://superset-dev.example.com
```

The `--superset=` option is useful in case you want to debug a production issue or have to setup Superset behind a firewall.
It allows you to run Flask server in another environment while keep assets building locally for the best developer experience.

#### Other npm commands

Alternatively, there are other NPM commands you may find useful:

1. `npm run build-dev`: build assets in development mode.
2. `npm run dev`: built dev assets in watch mode, will automatically rebuild when a file changes
