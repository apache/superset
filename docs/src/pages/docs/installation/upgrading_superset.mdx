## Upgrading Superset

### Docker Compose

First make sure to wind down the running containers in Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

Then, update the folder that mirrors the `superset` repo through git:

```bash
cd superset/
git pull origin master
```

Then, restart the containers and any changed Docker images will be automatically pulled down:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

### Updating Superset Manually

To upgrade superset in a native installation, run the following commands:

```bash
pip install apache-superset --upgrade
superset db upgrade
superset init
```

While upgrading superset should not delete your charts and dashboards, we recommend following best
practices and to backup your metadata database before upgrading. Before upgrading production, we
recommend upgrading in a staging environment and upgrading production finally during off-peak usage.
