# Issue Code Reference

This page lists issue codes that may be displayed in
Superset and provides additional context.

## Issue 1000

```
The datasource is too large to query.
```

It's likely your datasource has grown too large to run the current
query, and is timing out. You can resolve this by reducing the
size of your datasource or by modifying your query to only process a
subset of your data.

## Issue 1001

```
The database is under an unusual load.
```

Your query may have timed out because of unusually high load on the
database engine. You can make your query simpler, or wait until the
database is under less load and try again.

## Issue 1002

```
The database returned an unexpected error.
```

Your query failed because of an error that occurred on the database.
This may be due to a syntax error, a bug in your query, or some other
internal failure within the database. This is usually not an
issue within Superset, but instead a problem with the underlying
database that serves your query.

## Issue 1003

```
There is a syntax error in the SQL query. Perhaps there was a misspelling or a typo.
```

Your query failed because of a syntax error within the underlying query. Please
validate that all columns or tables referenced within the query exist and are spelled
correctly.

## Issue 1004

```
The column was deleted or renamed in the database.
```

Your query failed because it is referencing a column that no longer exists in
the underlying datasource. You should modify the query to reference the
replacement column, or remove this column from your query.

## Issue 1005

```
The table was deleted or renamed in the database.
```

Your query failed because it is referencing a table that no longer exists in
the underlying database. You should modify your query to reference the correct
table.

## Issue 1006

```
One or more parameters specified in the query are missing.
```

Your query was not submitted to the database because it's missing one or more
parameters. You should define all the parameters referenced in the query in a
valid JSON document. Check that the parameters are spelled correctly and that
the document has a valid syntax.
