# Issue Code Reference

This page lists issue codes that may be displayed in
Superset and provides additional context.

## Issue 1000

```
The datasource is too large to query.
```

It's likely your datasource has grown too large to run the current
query, and is timing out. You can resolve this by reducing the
size of your datasource or by modifying your query to only process a
subset of your data.

## Issue 1001

```
The database is under an unusual load.
```

Your query may have timed out because of unusually high load on the
database engine. You can make your query simpler, or wait until the
database is under less load and try again.

## Issue 1002

```
The database returned an unexpected error.
```

Your query failed because of an error that occurred on the database.
This may be due to a syntax error, a bug in your query, or some other
internal failure within the database. This is usually not an
issue within Superset, but instead a problem with the underlying
database that serves your query.
