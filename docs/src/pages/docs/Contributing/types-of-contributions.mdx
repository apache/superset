## Types of Contributions

### Report Bug

The best way to report a bug is to file an issue on GitHub. Please include:

- Your operating system name and version.
- Superset version.
- Detailed steps to reproduce the bug.
- Any details about your local setup that might be helpful in troubleshooting.

When posting Python stack traces, please quote them using
[Markdown blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks/).

### Submit Ideas or Feature Requests

The best way is to file an issue on GitHub:

- Explain in detail how it would work.
- Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to implement.
- Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project, and that contributions are welcome :)

For large features or major changes to codebase, please create **Superset Improvement Proposal (SIP)**. See template from [SIP-0](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/5602)

### Fix Bugs

open to whoever wants to implement them.

### Implement Features

Look through the GitHub issues. Issues tagged with
`#feature` is open to whoever wants to implement it.

### Improve Documentation

Superset could always use better documentation,
whether as part of the official Superset docs,
in docstrings, `docs/*.rst` or even on the web as blog posts or
articles. See [Documentation](#documentation) for more details.

### Add Translations

If you are proficient in a non-English language, you can help translate
text strings from Superset's UI. You can jump in to the existing
language dictionaries at
`superset/translations/<language_code>/LC_MESSAGES/messages.po`, or
even create a dictionary for a new language altogether.
See [Translating](#translating) for more details.

### Ask Questions

There is a dedicated [`apache-superset` tag](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/apache-superset) on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/). Please use it when asking questions.
