## Translating

We use [Babel](http://babel.pocoo.org/en/latest/) to translate Superset.
In Python files, we import the magic `_` function using:

```python
from flask_babel import lazy_gettext as _
```

then wrap our translatable strings with it, e.g. `_('Translate me')`.
During extraction, string literals passed to `_` will be added to the
generated `.po` file for each language for later translation.

At runtime, the `_` function will return the translation of the given
string for the current language, or the given string itself
if no translation is available.

In TypeScript/JavaScript, the technique is similar:
we import `t` (simple translation), `tn` (translation containing a number).

```javascript
import { t, tn } from "@superset-ui/translation";
```

### Enabling language selection

Add the `LANGUAGES` variable to your `superset_config.py`. Having more than one
option inside will add a language selection dropdown to the UI on the right side
of the navigation bar.

```python
LANGUAGES = {
    'en': {'flag': 'us', 'name': 'English'},
    'fr': {'flag': 'fr', 'name': 'French'},
    'zh': {'flag': 'cn', 'name': 'Chinese'},
}
```

### Extracting new strings for translation

```bash
pybabel extract -F superset/translations/babel.cfg -o superset/translations/messages.pot -k _ -k __ -k t -k tn -k tct .
```

This will update the template file `superset/translations/messages.pot` with current application strings. Do not forget to update
this file with the appropriate license information.

### Updating language files

```bash
 pybabel update -i superset/translations/messages.pot -d superset/translations --ignore-obsolete
```

This will update language files with the new extracted strings.

You can then translate the strings gathered in files located under
`superset/translation`, where there's one per language. You can use [Poedit](https://poedit.net/features)
to translate the `po` file more conveniently.
There are some [tutorials in the wiki](https://wiki.lxde.org/en/Translate_*.po_files_with_Poedit).

In the case of JS translation, we need to convert the PO file into a JSON file, and we need the global download of the npm package po2json.

```bash
npm install -g po2json
```

To convert all PO files to formatted JSON files you can use the `po2json.sh` script.

```bash
./scripts/po2json.sh
```

If you get errors running `po2json`, you might be running the Ubuntu package with the same
name, rather than the Node.js package (they have a different format for the arguments). If
there is a conflict, you may need to update your `PATH` environment variable or fully qualify
the executable path (e.g. `/usr/local/bin/po2json` instead of `po2json`).
If you get a lot of `[null,***]` in `messages.json`, just delete all the `null,`.
For example, `"year":["年"]` is correct while `"year":[null,"年"]`is incorrect.

For the translations to take effect we need to compile translation catalogs into binary MO files.

```bash
pybabel compile -d superset/translations
```

### Creating a new language dictionary

To create a dictionary for a new language, run the following, where `LANGUAGE_CODE` is replaced with
the language code for your target language, e.g. `es` (see [Flask AppBuilder i18n documentation](https://flask-appbuilder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/i18n.html) for more details):

```bash
pip install -r superset/translations/requirements.txt
pybabel init -i superset/translations/messages.pot -d superset/translations -l LANGUAGE_CODE
```

Then, [extract strings for the new language](#extracting-new-strings-for-translation).
