## Creating Visualization Plugins

Visualizations in Superset are implemented in JavaScript or TypeScript. Superset
comes preinstalled with several visualizations types (hereafter "viz plugins") that
can be found under the `superset-frontend/plugins` directory. Plugins are added to
the application in the `superset-frontend/src/visualizations/presets/MainPreset.js`.
The Superset project is always happy to review proposals for new high quality viz
plugins. However, for highly custom viz types it is recommended to maintain a fork
of Superset, and add the custom built plugins by hand.

### Prerequisites

In order to create a new visualization plugin, you need the following:

- Run MacOS or Linux (Windows is not officially supported, but may work)
- Node 16
- npm 7 or 8

### Creating a simple Hello World plugin

To get started, you need the Superset Yeoman Generator. It is recommended to use the
version of the template that ships with the version of Superset you are using. This
can be installed by doing the following:

```bash
npm i -g yo
cd superset-frontend/packages/generator-superset
npm link
```

After this you can proceed to create your viz plugin. Create a new directory wherever
you have your repos (we'll assume under `~/src/`) with the prefix
`superset-plugin-chart` and run the Yeoman generator:

```bash
cd ~/src
mkdir superset-plugin-chart-hello-world
cd superset-plugin-chart-hello-world
yo @superset-ui/superset
```

After that the generator will ask a few questions (the defaults should be fine):

```
$ yo @superset-ui/superset

   create test/plugin/buildQuery.test.ts
   create test/plugin/transformProps.test.ts
   create types/external.d.ts
   create src/images/thumbnail.png
```

To build the plugin, run the following commands:

```
npm i --force
npm run build
```

Alternatively, to run the plugin in development mode (=rebuilding whenever changes
are made), start the dev server with the following command:

```
npm run dev
```

To add the package to Superset, go to the `superset-frontend` subdirectory in your
Superset source folder (assuming both the `superset-plugin-chart-hello-world` plugin
and `superset` repos are in the same root directory) and run

```bash
npm i -S ../../superset-plugin-chart-hello-world
```

If you publish your package to npm, you can naturally install directly from there, too.
After this edit the `superset-frontend/src/visualizations/presets/MainPreset.js`
and make the following changes:

```js
import { SupersetPluginChartHelloWorld } from 'superset-plugin-chart-hello-world';
```

to import the plugin and later add the following to the array that's passed to the
`plugins` property:

```js
new SupersetPluginChartHelloWorld().configure({ key: 'ext-hello-world' }),
```

After that the plugin should show up when you run Superset, e.g. the development server:

```bash
npm run dev-server
```
