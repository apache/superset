## Git Hooks

Superset uses Git pre-commit hooks courtesy of [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/). To install run the following:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements/integration.txt
pre-commit install
```

A series of checks will now run when you make a git commit.

Alternatively it is possible to run pre-commit via tox:

```bash
tox -e pre-commit
```

Or by running pre-commit manually:

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

## Linting

### Python

We use [Pylint](https://pylint.org/) for linting which can be invoked via:

```bash
# for python
tox -e pylint
```

In terms of best practices please advoid blanket disablement of Pylint messages globally (via `.pylintrc`) or top-level within the file header, albeit there being a few exceptions. Disablement should occur inline as it prevents masking issues and provides context as to why said message is disabled.

Additionally the Python code is auto-formatted using [Black](https://github.com/python/black) which
is configured as a pre-commit hook. There are also numerous [editor integrations](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/editor_integration.html)

### TypeScript

```bash
cd superset-frontend
npm ci
npm run lint
```

If using the eslint extension with vscode, put the following in your workspace `settings.json` file:

```json
"eslint.workingDirectories": [
  "superset-frontend"
]
```
