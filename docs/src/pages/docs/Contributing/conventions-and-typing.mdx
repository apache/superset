## Conventions

### Python

Parameters in the `config.py` (which are accessible via the Flask app.config dictionary) are assumed to always be defined and thus should be accessed directly via,

```python
blueprints = app.config["BLUEPRINTS"]
```

rather than,

```python
blueprints = app.config.get("BLUEPRINTS")
```

or similar as the later will cause typing issues. The former is of type `List[Callable]` whereas the later is of type `Optional[List[Callable]]`.

## Typing

### Python

To ensure clarity, consistency, all readability, _all_ new functions should use
[type hints](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html) and include a
docstring.

Note per [PEP-484](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/#exceptions) no
syntax for listing explicitly raised exceptions is proposed and thus the
recommendation is to put this information in a docstring, i.e.,

```python
import math
from typing import Union


def sqrt(x: Union[float, int]) -> Union[float, int]:
    """
    Return the square root of x.

    :param x: A number
    :returns: The square root of the given number
    :raises ValueError: If the number is negative
    """

    return math.sqrt(x)
```

### TypeScript

TypeScript is fully supported and is the recommended language for writing all new frontend components. When modifying existing functions/components, migrating to TypeScript is appreciated, but not required. Examples of migrating functions/components to TypeScript can be found in [#9162](https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/9162) and [#9180](https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/9180).
