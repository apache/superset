We try our best to keep the
[Superset Roadmap](https://github.com/apache-superset/superset-roadmap/projects/1) updated.

Keep in mind that the roadmap represents only a subset of what's
ahead. Many contributions come directly without ever making it onto the roadmap.
Find out more about how the roadmap is managed in
[SIP (Superset Improvement Proposal) 53 - Proposal to create a Superset public roadmap ](https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/issues/10894)
