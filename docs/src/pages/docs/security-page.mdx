## Security

Apache Software Foundation takes a rigorous standpoint in annihilating the security issues in its
software projects. Apache Superset is highly sensitive and forthcoming to issues pertaining to its
features and functionality.

If you have apprehensions regarding Superset security or you discover vulnerability or potential
threat, donâ€™t hesitate to get in touch with the Apache Security Team by dropping a mail at
security@apache.org. In the mail, specify the project name Superset with the description of the
issue or potential threat. You are also urged to recommend the way to reproduce and replicate the
issue. The security team and the Superset community will get back to you after assessing and
analysing the findings.

PLEASE PAY ATTENTION to report the security issue on the security email before disclosing it on
public domain. The ASF Security Team maintains a page with the description of how vulnerabilities
and potential threats are handled, check their web page for more details.
