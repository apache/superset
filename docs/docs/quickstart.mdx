**Ready to give Apache Superset a try?** This quickstart guide will help you
get up and running on your local machine in **3 simple steps**. Note that
it assumes that you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com),
[docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/), and
[git](https://git-scm.com/) installed.

:::caution
While we recommend using `docker-compose` for a quick start in a sandbox-type
environment and for other development-type use cases, **we
do not recommend this setup for production**. For this purpose please
refer to our
[Installing on Kubernetes](/docs/installation/running-on-kubernetes/)
page.
:::

### 1. Get Superset

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/apache/superset
```

### 2. Start the latest official release of Superset

```bash
# Enter the repository you just cloned
$ cd superset

# Fire up Superset using docker-compose
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose-image-tag.yml up
```
This may take a moment as docker-compose will fetch the underlying
docker images and will load up some examples. Once all containers
are downloaded and the output settles, you're ready to log in.

### 3. Log into Superset
Now head over to [http://localhost:8088](http://localhost:8088) and log in with the default created account:
```bash
username: admin
password: admin
```

#### ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations! Superset is now up and running on your machine! ðŸŽ‰

### Wrapping Up
Once you're done with Superset, you can stop and delete just like any other container environment:
```bash
$ docker-compose down
```
:::tip
You can use the same environment more than once, as Superset will persist data locally. However, make sure to properly stop all
processes by running Docker Compose `stop` command. By doing so, you can avoid data corruption and/or loss of data.

## What's next?

From this point on, you can head on to:
- [Create your first Dashboard](/docs/creating-charts-dashboards/creating-your-first-dashboard)
- [Connect to a Database](/docs/databases/installing-database-drivers)
- [Using Docker Compose](/docs/installation/installing-superset-using-docker-compose): find
  out more about how to install docker & docker-compose, how to point to different Superset
  version, or how to set up your development environment.
- [Configure Superset](/docs/installation/configuring-superset/): Superset is highly configurable.
  Find out what the options are here.
- [Installing on Kubernetes](/docs/installation/running-on-kubernetes/): if you'd like to setup
  Superset in a production environment, we recommend using [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)
  and our official [Helm Chart](https://github.com/apache/superset/tree/master/helm/superset).

Or just explore our [Documentation](https://superset.apache.org/docs/intro)!
