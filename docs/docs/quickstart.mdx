**Ready to give Apache Superset a try?** This quickstart will help you run Superset on your local machine in
**5 simple steps**. It assumes that you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com) installed.

### 1. Get Superset
To get started, set the `SUPERSET_VERSION` environment variable with the latest Superset version.
[Click here](https://github.com/apache/superset/releases) to check the latest version.

```
$ export SUPERSET_VERSION=<latest_version>
```

Pull the Superset image from Docker Hub:

```
$ docker pull apache/superset:$SUPERSET_VERSION
```

### 2. Start Superset
:::tip
Note that some configuration is mandatory for Superset in order to start. In particular, Superset will not start without
a user-specified value of `SECRET_KEY` in a Superset configuration file or `SUPERSET_SECRET_KEY` as an environment variable.
Please see [Configuring Superset](https://superset.apache.org/docs/installation/configuring-superset/) for more details.
:::
```
$ docker run -d -p 8080:8088 \
             -e "SUPERSET_SECRET_KEY=$(openssl rand -base64 42)" \
             -e "TALISMAN_ENABLED=False" \
             --name superset apache/superset:$SUPERSET_VERSION
```

### 3. Create an account
```
$ docker exec -it superset superset fab create-admin \
              --username admin \
              --firstname Admin \
              --lastname Admin \
              --email admin@localhost \
              --password admin
```

### 4. Configure Superset
```
$ docker exec -it superset superset db upgrade &&
         docker exec -it superset superset load_examples &&
         docker exec -it superset superset init
```

This step can take some time. While you wait, feel free to join the official Slack channel to check for new releases,
ask questions, and engage with the community.

### 5. Start using Superset
After configuring your fresh instance, head over to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) and
log in with the default created account:
```
username: admin
password: admin
```

#### ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations! Superset is now up and running on your machine! ðŸŽ‰

### Wrapping Up
Once you're done with Superset, you can stop and remove it just like any other container:
```
$ docker container rm -f superset
```
:::tip
You can use the same container more than once, as Superset will persist data locally. However, make sure to properly stop all
processes by running Docker `stop` command. By doing so, you can avoid data corruption and/or loss of data.
