**Ready to try Apache Superset?** This quickstart guide will help you
get up and running on your local machine in **3 simple steps**. Note that
it assumes that you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com),
[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/), and
[Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed.

:::caution
Although we recommend using `Docker Compose` for a quick start in a sandbox-type
environment and for other development-type use cases, **we
do not recommend this setup for production**. For this purpose please
refer to our
[Installing on Kubernetes](/docs/installation/kubernetes/)
page.
:::

### 1. Get Superset

```bash
git clone https://github.com/apache/superset
```

### 2. Start the latest official release of Superset

```bash
# Enter the repository you just cloned
$ cd superset

# Set the repo to the state associated with the latest official version
$ git checkout tags/5.0.0

# Fire up Superset using Docker Compose
$ docker compose -f docker-compose-image-tag.yml up
```

This may take a moment as Docker Compose will fetch the underlying
container images and will load up some examples. Once all containers
are downloaded and the output settles, you're ready to log in.

‚ö†Ô∏è If you get an error message like `validating superset\docker-compose-image-tag.yml: services.superset-worker-beat.env_file.0 must be a string`, you need to update your version of `docker-compose`.
Note that `docker-compose` is on the path to deprecation and you should now use `docker compose` instead.

### 3. Log into Superset

Now head over to [http://localhost:8088](http://localhost:8088) and log in with the default created account:

```bash
username: admin
password: admin
```

#### üéâ Congratulations! Superset is now up and running on your machine! üéâ

### Wrapping Up

Once you're done with Superset, you can stop and delete just like any other container environment:

```bash
docker compose down
```

:::tip
You can use the same environment more than once, as Superset will persist data locally. However, make sure to properly stop all
processes by running Docker Compose `stop` command. By doing so, you can avoid data corruption and/or loss of data.

## Alternative: Setup with MCP Service (AI-Powered Features)

To enable AI-powered features through the MCP (Model Context Protocol) service, you can use Docker with the MCP profile:

### Option 1: Docker with MCP Service (Recommended)

```bash
# Clone the repository
$ git clone https://github.com/apache/superset
$ cd superset

# Build and start Superset and MCP service with docker-compose-light
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose-light.yml --profile mcp build
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose-light.yml --profile mcp up -d

# Initialize Superset (first time only)
$ docker exec -it superset-superset-light-1 superset fab create-admin \
  --username admin \
  --firstname Admin \
  --lastname Admin \
  --email admin@localhost \
  --password admin

$ docker exec -it superset-superset-light-1 superset db upgrade
$ docker exec -it superset-superset-light-1 superset init
```

The Docker setup automatically:
- Sets up PostgreSQL database
- Builds and runs Superset containers
- Starts the MCP service (with `--profile mcp`)
- Handles all networking and dependencies
- Provides hot-reload for development

Superset frontend will be available at http://localhost:9001 (login: admin/admin)

### Option 2: Manual Setup (Without Docker)

For manual setup instructions without Docker, see the [MCP Service Documentation](/docs/configuration/mcp-service#option-2-manual-setup)

For more details, see the [MCP Service Documentation](/docs/configuration/mcp-service) and [Development Setup](/docs/contributing/development).
