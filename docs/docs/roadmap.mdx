## Roadmap

You can find the approximate public roadmap for Superset [here](https://github.com/apache-superset/superset-roadmap/projects/1).

<a href="https://github.com/apache-superset/superset-roadmap/projects/1">
  <img
    src={useBaseUrl("/img/roadmap.png")}
    style={{
      maxWidth: "100%",
      boxShadow: "rgb(170, 170, 170) 0px 0px 3px 1px",
    }}
  />
</a>

Keep in mind that the roadmap represents only a subset of what's
ahead. Many contributions come directly without ever making it onto the roadmap.
