## Firebird

The recommended connector library for Firebird is [sqlalchemy-firebird](https://pypi.org/project/sqlalchemy-firebird/).
Superset has been tested on `sqlalchemy-firebird>=0.7.0, <0.8`.

The recommended connection string is:

```
firebird+fdb://{username}:{password}@{host}:{port}//{path_to_db_file}
```

Here's a connection string example of Superset connecting to a local Firebird database:

```
firebird+fdb://SYSDBA:masterkey@192.168.86.38:3050//Library/Frameworks/Firebird.framework/Versions/A/Resources/examples/empbuild/employee.fdb
```
