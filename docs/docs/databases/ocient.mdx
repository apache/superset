## Ocient DB

The recommended connector library for Ocient is [sqlalchemy-ocient](https://pypi.org/project/sqlalchemy-ocient).

## Install the Ocient Driver

```
pip install sqlalchemy-ocient
```

## Connecting to Ocient

The connection string for Ocient looks like this:

```shell
ocient://{user}:{password}@{DNSname}:{port}/{database}
```

**NOTE**: You must enter the `user` and `password` credentials.  `host` defaults to localhost,
port defaults to 4050, database defaults to `system` and `tls` defaults
to `off`.

## User Access Control

Make sure the user has privileges to access and use all required databases, schemas, tables, views, and warehouses, as the Ocient SQLAlchemy engine does not test for user or role rights by default.
