## ClickHouse

To use ClickHouse with Superset, you will need to add the following Python library:

```
clickhouse-sqlalchemy>=0.2.2
```

If running Superset using Docker Compose, add the following to your `./docker/requirements-local.txt` file:

```
clickhouse-sqlalchemy>=0.2.2
```

The recommended connector library for ClickHouse is
[sqlalchemy-clickhouse](https://github.com/cloudflare/sqlalchemy-clickhouse).

The expected connection string is formatted as follows:

```
clickhouse+native://<user>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<database>[?optionsâ€¦]clickhouse://{username}:{password}@{hostname}:{port}/{database}
```

Here's a concrete example of a real connection string:

```
clickhouse+native://demo:demo@github.demo.trial.altinity.cloud/default?secure=true
```

If you're using Clickhouse locally on your computer, you can get away with using a native protocol URL that
uses the default user without a password (and doesn't encrypt the connection):

```
clickhouse+native://localhost/default
```
