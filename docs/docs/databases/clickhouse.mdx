## ClickHouse

To use ClickHouse with Superset, you will need to add the following Python library:

```
clickhouse-connect>=0.4.1
```

If running Superset using Docker Compose, add the following to your `./docker/requirements-local.txt` file:

```
clickhouse-connect>=0.4.1
```

The recommended connector library for ClickHouse is
[clickhouse-connect](https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-connect).

The expected connection string is formatted as follows:

```
clickhousedb://<user>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<database>[?optionsâ€¦]clickhouse://{username}:{password}@{hostname}:{port}/{database}
```

Here's a concrete example of a real connection string:

```
clickhousedb://demo:demo@github.demo.trial.altinity.cloud/default?secure=true
```

If you're using Clickhouse locally on your computer, you can get away with using a http protocol URL that
uses the default user without a password (and doesn't encrypt the connection):

```
clickhousedb://localhost/default
```
