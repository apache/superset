## AWS Redshift

The [sqlalchemy-redshift](https://pypi.org/project/sqlalchemy-redshift/) library is the recommended
way to connect to Redshift through SQLAlchemy.

This dialect requires either [redshift_connector](https://pypi.org/project/redshift-connector/) or [psycopg2](https://pypi.org/project/psycopg2/) to work properly.

You'll need to set the following values to form the connection string:

- **User Name**: userName
- **Password**: DBPassword
- **Database Host**: AWS Endpoint
- **Database Name**: Database Name
- **Port**: default 5439


### psycopg2

Here's what the SQLALCHEMY URI looks like:

```
redshift+psycopg2://<userName>:<DBPassword>@<AWS End Point>:5439/<Database Name>
```


### redshift_connector

Here's what the SQLALCHEMY URI looks like:

```
redshift+redshift_connector://<userName>:<DBPassword>@<AWS End Point>:5439/<Database Name>
```


#### Using IAM-based credentials with Redshift cluster:

[Amazon redshift cluster](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/working-with-clusters.html) also supports generating temporary IAM-based database user credentials.

Your superset app's [IAM role should have permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/generating-iam-credentials-role-permissions.html) to call the `redshift:GetClusterCredentials` operation.

You have to define the following arguments in Superset's redshift database connection UI under ADVANCED --> Others --> ENGINE PARAMETERS.

```
{"connect_args":{"iam":true,"database":"<database>","cluster_identifier":"<cluster_identifier>","db_user":"<db_user>"}}
```
and SQLALCHEMY URI should be set to `redshift+redshift_connector://`


#### Using IAM-based credentials with Redshift serverless:

[Redshift serverless](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/serverless-whatis.html) supports connection using IAM roles.

Your superset app's IAM role should have `redshift-serverless:GetCredentials` and `redshift-serverless:GetWorkgroup` permissions on Redshift serverless workgroup.

You have to define the following arguments in Superset's redshift database connection UI under ADVANCED --> Others --> ENGINE PARAMETERS.

```
{"connect_args":{"iam":true,"is_serverless":true,"serverless_acct_id":"<aws account number>","serverless_work_group":"<redshift work group>","database":"<database>","user":"IAMR:<superset iam role name>"}}
```
