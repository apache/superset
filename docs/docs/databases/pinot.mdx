## Apache Pinot

The recommended connector library for Apache Pinot is [pinotdb](https://pypi.org/project/pinotdb/).

The expected connection string is formatted as follows:

```
pinot+http://<pinot-broker-host>:<pinot-broker-port>/query?controller=http://<pinot-controller-host>:<pinot-controller-port>/``
```

### Customizing Pinot Connection

The default request timeout is 5 seconds. To extend the timeout,
add the following to the engine params:

```
engine_params:
  {"connect_args": {"timeout": <seconds>}}
```
