## Teradata

The recommended connector library is
[teradatasqlalchemy](https://pypi.org/project/teradatasqlalchemy/).

The connection string for Teradata looks like this:

```
teradata://{user}:{password}@{host}
```

## ODBC Driver

There's also an older connector named
 [sqlalchemy-teradata](https://github.com/Teradata/sqlalchemy-teradata) that
 requires the installation of ODBC drivers. The Teradata ODBC Drivers
 are available
here: https://downloads.teradata.com/download/connectivity/odbc-driver/linux

Here are the required environment variables:

```
export ODBCINI=/.../teradata/client/ODBC_64/odbc.ini
export ODBCINST=/.../teradata/client/ODBC_64/odbcinst.ini
```

We recommend using the first library because of the
 lack of requirement around ODBC drivers and
 because it's more regularly updated.
