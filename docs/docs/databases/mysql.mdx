## MySQL

The recommended connector library for MySQL is `[mysqlclient](https://pypi.org/project/mysqlclient/)`.

Here's the connection string:

```
mysql://{username}:{password}@{host}/{database}
```

Host:

- For Localhost or Docker running Linux: `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`
- For On Prem: IP address or Host name
- For Docker running in OSX: `docker.for.mac.host.internal`
  Port: `3306` by default

One problem with `mysqlclient` is that it will fail to connect to newer MySQL databases using `caching_sha2_password` for authentication, since the plugin is not included in the client. In this case, you should use `[mysql-connector-python](https://pypi.org/project/mysql-connector-python/)` instead:

```
mysql+mysqlconnector://{username}:{password}@{host}/{database}
```
