# Upgrading Superset

## Docker Compose

First, make sure to shut down the running containers in Docker Compose:

```bash
docker compose down
```

Next, update the folder that mirrors the `superset` repo through git:

```bash
git pull origin master
```

Then, restart the containers and any changed Docker images will be automatically pulled down:

```bash
docker compose up
```

## Updating Superset Manually

To upgrade superset in a native installation, run the following commands:

```bash
pip install apache_superset --upgrade
```

## Upgrading the Metadata Database

Migrate the metadata database by running:

```bash
superset db upgrade
superset init
```

While upgrading superset should not delete your charts and dashboards, we recommend following best
practices and to backup your metadata database before upgrading. Before upgrading production, we
recommend upgrading in a staging environment and upgrading production finally during off-peak usage.
