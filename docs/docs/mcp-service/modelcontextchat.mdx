# Using ModelContextChat.com with Superset MCP

:::warning Development Use Only
This guide describes a setup intended for development, testing, and sandboxing purposes only. Do not use this configuration in production environments.
:::

ModelContextChat.com provides a web-based interface for connecting to Superset's MCP (Model Context Protocol) service. This allows you to interact with Superset using natural language through Claude AI, without needing to install any additional software.

## Overview

ModelContextChat.com is a no-code solution that:
- Requires no installation or setup
- Connects directly to your Superset MCP service
- Provides a chat interface powered by Claude AI
- Supports all MCP tools exposed by Superset

## Prerequisites

Before using ModelContextChat.com, ensure:

1. **Superset MCP service is running**:
   ```bash
   # Using docker-compose
   docker-compose -f docker-compose-light.yml --profile mcp up

   # Or in Codespaces with MCP profile
   ENABLE_MCP=true .devcontainer/start-superset.sh
   ```

2. **MCP service is accessible**:
   - Default port: 5008
   - For local development: `http://localhost:5008`
   - For remote/deployed instances: `https://your-domain.com:5008`

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Access ModelContextChat.com

Navigate to [ModelContextChat.com](https://modelcontextchat.com) in your web browser.

### Step 2: Configure MCP Connection

1. Click on the **MCP Connection** settings
2. Enter your MCP server details:
   - **Server URL**: `http://localhost:5008` (for local development)
   - **Authentication**: Configure if your MCP service requires auth

### Step 3: Select Claude Model

Choose your preferred Claude model:
- Claude 3.7 Sonnet (recommended for general use)
- Claude 3 Opus (for complex analysis)
- Claude 3 Haiku (for faster responses)

### Step 4: Start Chatting

Once connected (you'll see a green "MCP Connected" indicator), you can start asking questions about your Superset instance.

## Example Queries

Here are some example queries you can try:

### Dashboard Operations
```
"Can you list my dashboards in my Superset instance?"
"Show me the details of the Sales Dashboard"
"What charts are in the FCC New Coder Survey 2018 dashboard?"
```

### Chart Analysis
```
"List all charts that use the flights dataset"
"Show me the configuration of the World Bank's Data chart"
"What type of visualization is used in the COVID Vaccine Dashboard?"
```

### Dataset Exploration
```
"What datasets are available?"
"Show me the columns in the flights table"
"What metrics are defined on the energy_usage dataset?"
```

### SQL Lab Queries
```
"Can you run a query to show the top 10 countries by GDP?"
"Execute: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM flights WHERE year = 2024"
"Show me the schema of the public database"
```

## Available MCP Tools

ModelContextChat.com can access all MCP tools exposed by Superset:

- **Dashboard Tools**: list, get details, get charts, get filters
- **Chart Tools**: list, get details, get data, export
- **Dataset Tools**: list, get details, get columns, refresh
- **Database Tools**: list, get schemas, test connection
- **SQL Lab Tools**: execute queries, get query history
- **System Tools**: get instance info, get version

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

If you see "MCP Disconnected":
1. Verify your MCP service is running: `curl http://localhost:5008/health`
2. Check for CORS issues if accessing from a different domain
3. Ensure any required authentication is configured

### No Results

If tools return no data:
1. Verify you have the necessary permissions in Superset
2. Check that your Superset instance has data (dashboards, charts, etc.)
3. Review MCP service logs for any errors

### Performance

For better performance:
1. Use more specific queries rather than broad requests
2. Limit result sets when querying large datasets
3. Consider using Claude 3 Haiku for faster responses

## Security Considerations

:::danger Not for Production Use
This setup exposes your MCP service to the public internet without authentication. It is strictly for development and sandboxing. Never use this configuration with production data or in production environments.
:::

When using ModelContextChat.com:

1. **Data Privacy**: Your queries and results pass through ModelContextChat.com servers
2. **Authentication**: For production, implement proper authentication - never expose MCP publicly
3. **Network Security**: Production deployments must use private networking, not public ports
4. **Access Control**: MCP respects Superset's built-in RBAC

## Team Usage

To enable your team to use ModelContextChat.com:

1. **Deploy MCP Service**: Ensure it's accessible to team members
2. **Share Connection Details**: Provide the MCP server URL and any auth credentials
3. **Training**: Share example queries and use cases
4. **Documentation**: Link to this guide for reference

## Alternative Clients

While ModelContextChat.com is the simplest option, other MCP clients include:
- Claude Desktop App (requires installation)
- Custom MCP client implementations
- Other web-based MCP clients

- Explore [MCP Architecture](architecture) to understand how it works
- Review [API Reference](api-reference) for advanced usage
- Check [Authentication](authentication) for securing your MCP service
