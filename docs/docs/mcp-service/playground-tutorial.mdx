# Playing with a ChatBot UI + Superset MCP

This tutorial walks you through setting up and using a chat interface to interact with your Superset instance via the Model Context Protocol (MCP). We'll use ModelContextChat.com as our chat interface and connect it to your Superset MCP service.

## Prerequisites

- A running Superset instance with MCP service
- GitHub Codespaces or local development environment
- Credit card for OpenRouter API access (small amount needed)

## Step 1: Make Your MCP Port Public

By default, your MCP service port (5008) is private. You need to make it public so ModelContextChat.com can connect to it.

### In GitHub Codespaces:

1. Navigate to the **PORTS** tab in your Codespace
2. Find port **5008** (MCP Service)
3. Right-click on the port entry
4. Select **Port Visibility** â†’ **Public**

:::caution
Making the port public means anyone with the URL can access your MCP service. Only do this for development/testing purposes.
:::

## Step 2: Set Up OpenRouter Account

ModelContextChat.com uses OpenRouter to access various AI models. You'll need an OpenRouter account and API key.

### Why OpenRouter?

While this requires a credit card and some setup, OpenRouter is:
- A reputable service that provides access to all the latest AI models
- Useful beyond just this tutorial - you can use it for other AI projects
- Pay-as-you-go pricing - you only pay for what you use
- A good investment for developers working with AI

### Setup Steps:

1. **Create an OpenRouter Account**:
   - Go to [OpenRouter.com](https://openrouter.ai)
   - Sign up for an account
   - Verify your email

2. **Add Credits**:
   - Navigate to billing/credits section
   - Add a small amount of credits ($5-10 is plenty for testing)
   - OpenRouter uses pay-as-you-go pricing

3. **Create an API Key**:
   - Go to API Keys section
   - Click "Create New Key"
   - Give it a descriptive name (e.g., "ModelContextChat")
   - Copy the API key immediately (you won't see it again)

## Step 3: Configure ModelContextChat.com

Now we'll set up ModelContextChat.com to use your OpenRouter API key and connect to your MCP service.

### Initial Setup:

1. **Open ModelContextChat.com**:
   - Navigate to [ModelContextChat.com](https://modelcontextchat.com)
   - You'll be prompted for an API key

2. **Enter OpenRouter API Key**:
   - Paste the API key you copied from OpenRouter
   - The key will be stored locally in your browser

3. **Select Your Model**:
   - Choose your preferred model (e.g., Claude 3.5 Sonnet)
   - Different models have different costs and capabilities

## Step 4: Connect to Your MCP Service

Now we need to tell ModelContextChat.com how to connect to your Superset MCP service.

### Create MCP Connection:

1. **Access MCP Settings**:
   - Look for MCP connection settings (usually a settings icon or "Add MCP Server")

2. **Configure Connection**:
   ```
   Name: Superset MCP
   URL: https://<your-codespace-url>-5008.app.github.dev
   ```

   :::tip Finding Your URL
   In Codespaces, click on the port 5008 forwarded URL to get the full public URL.
   It will look something like: `https://fictional-space-123abc-5008.app.github.dev`
   :::

3. **Test Connection**:
   - ModelContextChat should show a green "Connected" indicator
   - If not, check that port 5008 is public and the URL is correct

## Step 5: Start Chatting with Your Superset Data

Once connected, you can start asking questions about your Superset instance!

### Example Queries to Try:

#### Basic Information:
```
"What dashboards are available in my Superset instance?"
"Show me all the charts in the Sales Dashboard"
"What datasets do I have access to?"
```

#### Data Exploration:
```
"List all charts that use the flights dataset"
"What columns are available in the energy_usage table?"
"Show me the SQL query for the Revenue by Region chart"
```

#### Advanced Operations:
```
"Export the data from the COVID Vaccine Dashboard to CSV"
"Create a line chart showing monthly revenue trends"
"Generate an explore link for the customer demographics dataset"
```

## Step 6: Understanding the Interface

### Key UI Elements:

- **Connection Status**: Shows if you're connected to the MCP service
- **Model Selection**: Choose which AI model to use
- **Tool Executions**: See which MCP tools are being called
- **Chat History**: Your conversation is saved locally

### Tips for Better Results:

1. **Be Specific**: Instead of "show me data", say "show me the top 10 countries by GDP from the World Bank dataset"
2. **Use Dashboard/Chart Names**: Reference specific dashboards or charts by name
3. **Check Tool Executions**: The UI shows which tools are being called - this helps understand what's happening

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

If you see "MCP Disconnected":

1. **Verify Port is Public**:
   - Check Codespaces PORTS tab
   - Ensure port 5008 shows "Public"

2. **Check MCP Service**:
   ```bash
   # In your Codespace terminal
   curl http://localhost:5008/health
   ```

3. **Correct URL Format**:
   - Should be HTTPS (not HTTP) for Codespaces
   - Include the full domain with port forwarding

### Authentication Errors

If you get authentication errors:
- Your MCP service might require additional auth configuration
- Check MCP service logs for details

### No Data Returned

If queries return empty results:
- Ensure your Superset instance has data
- Check that you have proper permissions in Superset
- Try simpler queries first

## Security Considerations

:::warning Production Use
This tutorial is for development/testing only. For production:
- Don't make MCP ports public
- Use proper authentication
- Consider VPN or private networking
- Audit access logs regularly
:::

## Next Steps

- Explore more [MCP tools and capabilities](api-reference)
- Learn about [securing your MCP service](authentication)
- Build your own MCP client application
- Try other models available through OpenRouter

## Cost Estimation

Typical costs for this tutorial:
- OpenRouter API: ~$0.01-0.10 per conversation (depends on model and length)
- Most testing can be done with $5-10 in credits
- Claude 3.5 Sonnet is recommended for best results with MCP tools
