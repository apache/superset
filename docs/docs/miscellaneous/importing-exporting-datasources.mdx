## Importing and Exporting Datasources

The superset cli allows you to import and export datasources from and to YAML. Datasources include
databases. The data is expected to be organized in the following hierarchy:

```
├──databases
|  ├──database_1
|  |  ├──table_1
|  |  |  ├──columns
|  |  |  |  ├──column_1
|  |  |  |  ├──column_2
|  |  |  |  └──... (more columns)
|  |  |  └──metrics
|  |  |     ├──metric_1
|  |  |     ├──metric_2
|  |  |     └──... (more metrics)
|  |  └── ... (more tables)
|  └── ... (more databases)
```

### Exporting Datasources to YAML

You can print your current datasources to stdout by running:

```
superset export_datasources
```

To save your datasources to a ZIP file run:

```
superset export_datasources -f <filename>
```

By default, default (null) values will be omitted. Use the -d flag to include them. If you want back
references to be included (e.g. a column to include the table id it belongs to) use the -b flag.

Alternatively, you can export datasources using the UI:

1. Open **Sources -> Databases** to export all tables associated to a single or multiple databases.
   (**Tables** for one or more tables)
2. Select the items you would like to export.
3. Click **Actions -> Export** to YAML
4. If you want to import an item that you exported through the UI, you will need to nest it inside
   its parent element, e.g. a database needs to be nested under databases a table needs to be nested
   inside a database element.

In order to obtain an **exhaustive list of all fields** you can import using the YAML import run:

```
superset export_datasource_schema
```

As a reminder, you can use the `-b` flag to include back references.

### Importing Datasources

In order to import datasources from a ZIP file, run:

```
superset import_datasources -p <path / filename>
```

The username flag **-u** sets the user used for the datasource import. The default is 'admin'. in order to sync the supplied elements with your file. Be
careful this can delete the contents of your meta database. Example:

```
superset import_datasources -p <path / filename> -u 'admin'
```
