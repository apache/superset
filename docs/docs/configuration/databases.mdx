# Connecting to Databases

Superset does not ship bundled with connectivity to databases. The main step in connecting
Superset to a database is to **install the proper database driver(s)**
in your environment.

:::note
You'll need to install the required packages for the database you want to use as your metadata database
as well as the packages needed to connect to the databases you want to access through Superset.
For information about setting up Superset's metadata database, please refer to
installation documentations ([Docker Compose](/docs/installation/docker-compose), [Kubernetes](/docs/installation/kubernetes))
:::

This documentation tries to keep pointer to the different drivers for commonly used database
engine.

## Installing Database Drivers

Superset requires a Python [DB-API database driver](https://peps.python.org/pep-0249/)
and a [SQLAlchemy dialect](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/dialects/) to be installed for
each database engine you want to connect to.

You can read more [here](#installing-drivers-in-docker-images) about how to
install new database drivers into your Superset configuration.

## Supported Databases Overview

The following table shows all databases supported by Superset, along with their feature support
and documentation status. Click on any database name to jump to its detailed documentation.

<DatabaseIndex data={databaseData} />

---

Note that many other databases are supported, the main criteria being the existence of a functional
SQLAlchemy dialect and Python driver. Searching for the keyword "sqlalchemy + (database name)"
should help get you to the right place.

If your database or data engine isn't on the list but a SQL interface
exists, please file an issue on the
[Superset GitHub repo](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues), so we can work on documenting and
supporting it.

If you'd like to build a database connector for Superset integration,
read the [following tutorial](https://preset.io/blog/building-database-connector/).

## Installing Drivers in Docker Images

Superset requires a Python database driver to be installed for each additional
type of database you want to connect to.

In this example, we'll walk through how to install the MySQL connector library.
The connector library installation process is the same for all additional libraries.

### 1. Determine the driver you need

Consult the [list of database drivers](#supported-databases-overview) above
and find the PyPI package needed to connect to your database. In this example, we're connecting
to a MySQL database, so we'll need the `mysqlclient` connector library.

### 2. Install the driver in the container

We need to get the `mysqlclient` library installed into the Superset docker container
(it doesn't matter if it's installed on the host machine). We could enter the running
container with `docker exec -it <container_name> bash` and run `pip install mysqlclient`
there, but that wouldn't persist permanently.

To address this, the Superset `docker compose` deployment uses the convention
of a `requirements-local.txt` file. All packages listed in this file will be installed
into the container from PyPI at runtime. This file will be ignored by Git for
the purposes of local development.

Create the file `requirements-local.txt` in a subdirectory called `docker` that
exists in the directory with your `docker-compose.yml` or `docker-compose-non-dev.yml` file.

```bash
# Run from the repo root:
touch ./docker/requirements-local.txt
```

Add the driver identified in step above. You can use a text editor or do
it from the command line like:

```bash
echo "mysqlclient" >> ./docker/requirements-local.txt
```

**If you are running a stock (non-customized) Superset image**, you are done.
Launch Superset with `docker compose -f docker-compose-non-dev.yml up` and
the driver should be present.

You can check its presence by entering the running container with
`docker exec -it <container_name> bash` and running `pip freeze`. The PyPI package should
be present in the printed list.

**If you're running a customized docker image**, rebuild your local image with the new
driver baked in:

```bash
docker compose build --force-rm
```

After the rebuild of the Docker images is complete, relaunch Superset by
running `docker compose up`.

### 3. Connect to the Database

Now that you've got a database driver installed in your container, you should be able to connect
to your database via the Superset web UI.

As an admin user, go to Settings -> Data: Database Connections and click the +DATABASE button.
From there, follow the steps on the
[Using Database Connection UI page](#connecting-through-the-ui).

Consult the documentation for your specific database type below to determine
the connection string and any other parameters you need to input.

Click the "Test Connection" button, which should result in a popup message saying,
"Connection looks good!".

### 4. Troubleshooting

If the test fails, review your docker logs for error messages. Superset uses SQLAlchemy
to connect to databases; to troubleshoot the connection string for your database, you might
start Python in the Superset application container or host environment and try to connect
directly to the desired database and fetch data. This eliminates Superset for the
purposes of isolating the problem.

Repeat this process for each type of database you want Superset to connect to.

## Connecting Through the UI

The preferred way to add a database is via the Database Connection UI feature, accessible in
the menu under Settings -> Data: Database Connections. This UI provides a guided flow
for entering connection details.

Here is a screenshot of the modal:

<img src="/img/tutorial/tutorial_01_add_database.png" alt="Add Database" width="600"/>

For most databases, you'll need:
- **Display Name**: A friendly name for this connection
- **SQLAlchemy URI**: The connection string (format depends on the database)
- **Additional Parameters**: Optional JSON configuration

### Testing Your Connection

Always click "Test Connection" before saving. Common issues include:
- Incorrect credentials
- Network/firewall blocking the connection
- Missing database driver
- SSL/TLS configuration issues

## Database-Specific Documentation

Below is detailed documentation for each supported database, including connection strings,
authentication methods, driver options, and advanced configuration.

{Object.entries(databaseData.databases)
  .sort(([a], [b]) => a.localeCompare(b))
  .map(([name, db]) => (
    <DatabasePage key={name} name={name} database={db} />
  ))}

## Additional Resources

### Adding New Database Drivers

If your database isn't listed above, you may still be able to connect if:
1. A SQLAlchemy dialect exists for the database
2. A Python DB-API driver is available

Search for "sqlalchemy + (your database name)" to find available dialects.

### Contributing Documentation

To add or improve database documentation:
1. Update the `DATABASE_DOCS` dictionary in `superset/db_engine_specs/lib.py`
2. Run `yarn generate:database-docs` in the `docs/` directory
3. The documentation pages will be automatically generated

This ensures that documentation stays in sync with the codebase and can be
verified programmatically.
