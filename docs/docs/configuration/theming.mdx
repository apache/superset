# Theming Superset

:::note
apache-superset>=6.0
:::

Superset now rides on **Ant Design v5's token-based theming**.
Every Antd token works, plus a handful of Superset-specific ones for charts and dashboard chrome.

## Managing Themes via CRUD Interface

Superset now includes a built-in **Theme Management** interface accessible from the admin menu under **Settings > Themes**.

### Creating a New Theme

1. Navigate to **Settings > Themes** in the Superset interface
2. Click **+ Theme** to create a new theme
3. Use the [Ant Design Theme Editor](https://ant.design/theme-editor) to design your theme:
   - Design your palette, typography, and component overrides
   - Open the `CONFIG` modal and copy the JSON configuration
4. Paste the JSON into the theme definition field in Superset
5. Give your theme a descriptive name and save

You can also extend with Superset-specific tokens (documented in the default theme object) before you import.

### Applying Themes to Dashboards

Once created, themes can be applied to individual dashboards:
- Edit any dashboard and select your custom theme from the theme dropdown
- Each dashboard can have its own theme, allowing for branded or context-specific styling

## Alternative: Instance-wide Configuration

For system-wide theming, you can configure default themes via Python configuration:

### Setting Default Themes

```python
# superset_config.py

# Default theme (light mode)
THEME_DEFAULT = {
    "token": {
        "colorPrimary": "#2893B3",
        "colorSuccess": "#5ac189",
        # ... your theme JSON configuration
    }
}

# Dark theme configuration
THEME_DARK = {
    "algorithm": "dark",
    "token": {
        "colorPrimary": "#2893B3",
        # ... your dark theme overrides
    }
}

# Theme behavior settings
THEME_SETTINGS = {
    "enforced": False,          # If True, forces default theme always
    "allowSwitching": True,     # Allow users to switch between themes
    "allowOSPreference": True,  # Auto-detect system theme preference
}
```

### Copying Themes from CRUD Interface

To use a theme created via the CRUD interface as your system default:

1. Navigate to **Settings > Themes** and edit your desired theme
2. Copy the complete JSON configuration from the theme definition field
3. Paste it directly into your `superset_config.py` as shown above

Restart Superset to apply changes.

## Theme Development Workflow

1. **Design**: Use the [Ant Design Theme Editor](https://ant.design/theme-editor) to iterate on your design
2. **Test**: Create themes in Superset's CRUD interface for testing
3. **Apply**: Assign themes to specific dashboards or configure instance-wide
4. **Iterate**: Modify theme JSON directly in the CRUD interface or re-import from the theme editor

## Advanced Features

- **System Themes**: Superset includes built-in light and dark themes
- **Per-Dashboard Theming**: Each dashboard can have its own visual identity
- **JSON Editor**: Edit theme configurations directly within Superset's interface
