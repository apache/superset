# Theming Superset

:::note
apache-superset>=6.0
:::

Superset now rides on **Ant Design v5's token-based theming**.
Every Antd token works, plus a handful of Superset-specific ones for charts and dashboard chrome.

## Managing Themes via CRUD Interface

Superset now includes a built-in **Theme Management** interface accessible from the admin menu under **Settings > Themes**.

### Creating a New Theme

1. Navigate to **Settings > Themes** in the Superset interface
2. Click **+ Theme** to create a new theme
3. Use the [Ant Design Theme Editor](https://ant.design/theme-editor) to design your theme:
   - Design your palette, typography, and component overrides
   - Open the `CONFIG` modal and copy the JSON configuration
4. Paste the JSON into the theme definition field in Superset
5. Give your theme a descriptive name and save

You can also extend with Superset-specific tokens (documented in the default theme object) before you import.

### Applying Themes to Dashboards

Once created, themes can be applied to individual dashboards:
- Edit any dashboard and select your custom theme from the theme dropdown
- Each dashboard can have its own theme, allowing for branded or context-specific styling

## Alternative: Instance-wide Configuration

For system-wide theming, you can configure default themes via Python configuration:

### Setting Default Themes

```python
# superset_config.py

# Default theme (light mode)
THEME_DEFAULT = {
    "token": {
        "colorPrimary": "#2893B3",
        "colorSuccess": "#5ac189",
        # ... your theme JSON configuration
    }
}

# Dark theme configuration
THEME_DARK = {
    "algorithm": "dark",
    "token": {
        "colorPrimary": "#2893B3",
        # ... your dark theme overrides
    }
}

# Enable UI-based theme administration for admins
ENABLE_UI_THEME_ADMINISTRATION = True

# To force a single theme on all users, set THEME_DARK = None
# When both THEME_DEFAULT and THEME_DARK are defined:
# - Users can manually switch between themes
# - OS preference detection is automatically enabled
```

### Copying Themes from CRUD Interface

To use a theme created via the CRUD interface as your system default:

1. Navigate to **Settings > Themes** and edit your desired theme
2. Copy the complete JSON configuration from the theme definition field
3. Paste it directly into your `superset_config.py` as shown above

Restart Superset to apply changes.

## Theme Development Workflow

1. **Design**: Use the [Ant Design Theme Editor](https://ant.design/theme-editor) to iterate on your design
2. **Test**: Create themes in Superset's CRUD interface for testing
3. **Apply**: Assign themes to specific dashboards or configure instance-wide
4. **Iterate**: Modify theme JSON directly in the CRUD interface or re-import from the theme editor

## Custom Fonts

Superset supports custom fonts through runtime configuration, allowing you to use branded or custom typefaces without rebuilding the application.

### Configuring Custom Fonts

Add font URLs to your `superset_config.py`:

```python
# Load fonts from Google Fonts, Adobe Fonts, or self-hosted sources
CUSTOM_FONT_URLS = [
    "https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:wght@400;500;600;700&display=swap",
    "https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=JetBrains+Mono:wght@400;500&display=swap",
]

# Update CSP to allow font sources
TALISMAN_CONFIG = {
    "content_security_policy": {
        "font-src": ["'self'", "https://fonts.googleapis.com", "https://fonts.gstatic.com"],
        "style-src": ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'", "https://fonts.googleapis.com"],
    }
}
```

### Using Custom Fonts in Themes

Once configured, reference the fonts in your theme configuration:

```python
THEME_DEFAULT = {
    "token": {
        "fontFamily": "Inter, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, sans-serif",
        "fontFamilyCode": "JetBrains Mono, Monaco, monospace",
        # ... other theme tokens
    }
}
```

Or in the CRUD interface theme JSON:

```json
{
  "token": {
    "fontFamily": "Inter, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, sans-serif",
    "fontFamilyCode": "JetBrains Mono, Monaco, monospace"
  }
}
```

### Font Sources

- **Google Fonts**: Free, CDN-hosted fonts with wide variety
- **Adobe Fonts**: Premium fonts (requires subscription and kit ID)
- **Self-hosted**: Place font files in `/static/assets/fonts/` and reference via CSS

This feature works with the stock Docker image - no custom build required!

## Advanced Features

- **System Themes**: Superset includes built-in light and dark themes
- **Per-Dashboard Theming**: Each dashboard can have its own visual identity
- **JSON Editor**: Edit theme configurations directly within Superset's interface
- **Custom Fonts**: Load external fonts via configuration without rebuilding
