# Theming Superset

:::note
apache-superset>=6.0
:::

Superset now rides on **Ant Design v5’s token-based theming**.
Every Antd token works, plus a handful of Superset-specific ones for charts and dashboard chrome.

## 1 — Create a theme

1. Open the official **Ant Design Theme Editor**: <https://ant.design/theme-editor>
2. Design your palette, typography, and component overrides.
3. Open the `CONFIG` modal and paste the JSON.

You can also extend with Superset-specific tokens (documented in the default theme object) before you import.

## 2 — Apply it instance-wide

```python
# superset_config.py
THEME = {
    # Paste your JSON theme definition here
}
```

Restart Superset to apply changes

## 3 — Tweak live in the app (beta)

Set the feature flag in your `superset_config`
```python
DEFAULT_FEATURE_FLAGS: dict[str, bool] = {
    {{ ... }}
    THEME_ALLOW_THEME_EDITOR_BETA = True,
}
```

- Enables a JSON editor panel inside Superset as a new icon in the navbar
- Intended for testing/design and rapid in-context iteration
- End-user theme switching & preferences coming later

## 4 — Potential Next Steps

- CRUD UI for managing multiple themes
- Per-dashboard & per-workspace theme assignment
- User-selectable theme preferences
