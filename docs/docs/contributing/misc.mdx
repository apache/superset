## Reporting a Security Vulnerability

Please report security vulnerabilities to private@superset.apache.org.

In the event a community member discovers a security flaw in Superset, it is important to follow the [Apache Security Guidelines](https://www.apache.org/security/committers.html) and release a fix as quickly as possible before public disclosure. Reporting security vulnerabilities through the usual GitHub Issues channel is not ideal as it will publicize the flaw before a fix can be applied.

### SQL Lab Async

It's possible to configure a local database to operate in `async` mode,
to work on `async` related features.

To do this, you'll need to:

- Add an additional database entry. We recommend you copy the connection
  string from the database labeled `main`, and then enable `SQL Lab` and the
  features you want to use. Don't forget to check the `Async` box
- Configure a results backend, here's a local `FileSystemCache` example,
  not recommended for production,
  but perfect for testing (stores cache in `/tmp`)

  ```python
  from flask_caching.backends.filesystemcache import FileSystemCache
  RESULTS_BACKEND = FileSystemCache('/tmp/sqllab')
  ```

- Start up a celery worker

  ```shell script
  celery --app=superset.tasks.celery_app:app worker -O fair
  ```

Note that:

- for changes that affect the worker logic, you'll have to
  restart the `celery worker` process for the changes to be reflected.
- The message queue used is a `sqlite` database using the `SQLAlchemy`
  experimental broker. Ok for testing, but not recommended in production
- In some cases, you may want to create a context that is more aligned
  to your production environment, and use the similar broker as well as
  results backend configuration

### Async Chart Queries

It's possible to configure database queries for charts to operate in `async` mode. This is especially useful for dashboards with many charts that may otherwise be affected by browser connection limits. To enable async queries for dashboards and Explore, the following dependencies are required:

- Redis 5.0+ (the feature utilizes [Redis Streams](https://redis.io/topics/streams-intro))
- Cache backends enabled via the `CACHE_CONFIG` and `DATA_CACHE_CONFIG` config settings
- Celery workers configured and running to process async tasks
