# Superset Component Library

Welcome to the Apache Superset Component Library documentation. This section provides comprehensive documentation for all the UI components, chart components, and layout components used in Superset.

## What is the Component Library?

The Component Library is a collection of reusable UI components that are used to build the Superset user interface. These components are designed to be consistent, accessible, and easy to use.

## Component Categories

The Component Library is organized into the following categories:

### UI Components

Basic UI components like buttons, inputs, dropdowns, and other form elements.

### Chart Components

Visualization components used to render different types of charts and graphs.

### Layout Components

Components used for page layout, such as containers, grids, and navigation elements.

## Versioning

The Component Library documentation follows its own versioning scheme, independent from the main Superset documentation. This allows us to update the component documentation as the components evolve, without affecting the main documentation.

## Getting Started

Browse the sidebar to explore the different components available in the library. Each component documentation includes:

- Component description and purpose
- Props and configuration options
- Usage examples
- Best practices
