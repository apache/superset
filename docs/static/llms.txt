# Apache Superset

> Apache Superset is a modern, enterprise-ready business intelligence web application. It provides a no-code interface for building charts, a powerful SQL editor, support for nearly any SQL database, and beautiful visualizations. Superset is open source under the Apache 2.0 license.

Superset is designed for data exploration and visualization at scale. It features a lightweight semantic layer, configurable caching, extensible security with RBAC, a REST API for programmatic access, and a cloud-native architecture.
