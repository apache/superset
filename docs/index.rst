Apache Superset (incubating)
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Apache Superset (incubating) is a modern, enterprise-ready business
intelligence web application


----------------

.. warning:: This project was originally named Panoramix, was renamed to
    Caravel in March 2016, and is currently named Superset as of November 2016

.. important::

    **Disclaimer**: Apache Superset is an effort undergoing incubation at The
    Apache Software Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the Apache Incubator.
    Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a further
    review indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and
    decision making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with
    other successful ASF projects. While incubation status is not
    necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of
    the code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully
    endorsed by the ASF.
