Here's the source to the documentation hosted at
<a href="https://superset.apache.org">superset.apache.org</a>

The site runs on the Gatsby framework and uses docz for it's
`Documentation` subsection.

## Getting Started

```bash
cd docs/
npm install
npm run start
# navigate to localhost:8000`
```

## To Publish

Github Actions CI automatically publishes the site after changes are
merged to master.

To manually publish, the static site that Gatsby generates needs to be pushed
to the `asf-site` branch on the
[apache/superset-site](https://github.com/apache/superset-site/)
repository. No need to PR here, simply `git push`.

```bash
# Get in the docs/ folder in the main repo
cd ~/repos/superset/docs
# have Gatsby build the static website, this puts in under `docs/public`
npm run build

# go to the docs repo
cd ~/repos/superset-site
# checkout the proper branch
git checkout asf-site

# BE CAREFUL WITH THIS COMMAND
# wipe the content of the repo
rm -rf *

# copy the static site here
cp -r ~/repos/superset/docs/public/ ./

# git push
git add .
git commit -m "relevant commit msg"
git push origin asf-site

# SUCCESS - it should take minutes to take effect on superset.apache.org
```
