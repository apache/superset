# SCOPE: Remove the legacy viz pipeline (`explore_json` + `viz.py`)

> **This file is a working tracker for the `remove-legacy-viz-pipeline` feature branch.**
> It accumulates everything done on this branch and will be distilled into the final
> PR body. It is deleted before the feature branch merges to `master`.
> Companion file: [UPDATES.md](UPDATES.md) staging entries destined for `UPDATING.md`.

## Goal

Migrate every remaining `useLegacyApi: true` viz plugin to the v1 `/api/v1/chart/data`
endpoint (adding `buildQuery.ts` + `post_processing` operations / `transformProps`
reshaping as needed), then delete the deprecated `explore_json` endpoints and
`superset/viz.py` entirely, and drop the `legacy-` prefix from the surviving plugin
package names. Both endpoints have carried `@deprecated(eol_version="5.0.0")` gates;
this branch is the EOL.

## Inventory: the 15 remaining legacy viz types

| # | viz_type | Plugin | Strategy | Status |
|---|----------|--------|----------|--------|
| 1 | `para` | legacy-plugin-chart-parallel-coordinates | Convert in place (pass-through) | ✅ (merged) |
| 2 | `country_map` | legacy-plugin-chart-country-map | Convert in place (select/rename) | ✅ (merged) |
| 3 | `bullet` | legacy-preset-chart-nvd3/Bullet | Convert in place (single metric) | ✅ (merged) |
| 4 | `chord` | legacy-plugin-chart-chord | Convert in place (matrix in transformProps) | 🔃 (PR open) |
| 5 | `world_map` | legacy-plugin-chart-world-map | Convert in place (country join in JS) | 🔃 (PR open) |
| 6 | `paired_ttest` | legacy-plugin-chart-paired-t-test | Convert in place (pivot op) | 🔃 (PR open) |
| 7 | `time_table` | src/visualizations/TimeTable | Convert in place (pivot op) | 🔃 (PR open) |
| 8 | `cal_heatmap` | legacy-plugin-chart-calendar | Convert in place (pivot + epoch keys in JS) | ⬜ |
| 9 | `horizon` | legacy-plugin-chart-horizon | Convert in place (timeseries pipeline) | ⬜ |
| 10 | `rose` | legacy-plugin-chart-rose | Convert in place (timeseries pipeline) | ⬜ |
| 11 | `time_pivot` | legacy-preset-chart-nvd3/TimePivot | Convert in place (pivot + rank in JS) | ⬜ |
| 12 | `bubble` | legacy-preset-chart-nvd3/Bubble | Retarget → `bubble_v2` (MigrateViz exists, needs Alembic revision) | ⬜ |
| 13 | `compare` | legacy-preset-chart-nvd3/Compare | Retarget → `echarts_timeseries_line` (new MigrateViz) | ⬜ |
| 14 | `partition` | legacy-plugin-chart-partition | Convert in place (hierarchy in transformProps) | ⬜ |
| 15 | `deck_multi` | preset-chart-deckgl/Multi | Client-side filter-metadata merge + stub buildQuery | ⬜ |

"Convert in place" = keep the renderer and the `viz_type` key, add a modern
`buildQuery.ts`, move the `viz.py` `get_data()` reshape into `transformProps.ts`,
flip `useLegacyApi` off. No saved-chart DB migration needed since `viz_type` is
unchanged. "Retarget" = migrate saved charts to an existing modern chart via a
`MigrateViz` processor + Alembic revision, then delete the legacy plugin.

## Phases / sub-PRs (each targets this feature branch)

### Phase 0 — Dead code deletion
- [x] `superset-frontend/plugins/legacy-preset-chart-deckgl/` turned out to have **zero tracked files** — it was a stale local `node_modules/` husk, removed locally, nothing to commit
- [x] Delete `legacy-preset-chart-nvd3/src/BoxPlot/` leftovers (unregistered; superseded by ECharts BoxPlot)
- [x] Delete orphaned `viz.py` classes with no registered frontend: `MapboxViz`, `MapLibreViz`, `EventFlowViz` (no tests referenced them; `mapbox` saved charts were already migrated to `point_cluster_map` by revision `ce6bd21901ab`; the frontend `point_cluster_map` plugin has its own modern `buildQuery`, so removing `MapLibreViz` also fixes cache warm-up, which routed any `viz_type in viz_types` through the legacy path)

### Phase 1 — Chart migrations (tiers 1→4, easiest first; order above)
Per-chart checklist:
- [ ] `buildQuery.ts` returning a `buildQueryContext(...)` with needed `post_processing` operators
- [ ] `transformProps.ts` ports the `viz.py` `get_data()` reshape (where not expressible as post_processing)
- [ ] `useLegacyApi` removed from plugin metadata
- [ ] Jest tests: buildQuery output + transformProps against fixtures captured from the legacy pipeline
- [ ] Verify legacy saved-chart `form_data` (`granularity_sqla`/`time_range`) flows through `buildQueryContext` — add a normalizing same-viz-type `MigrateViz` if not
- [ ] For retargets: `MigrateViz` processor + `superset/cli/viz_migrations.py` registration + Alembic revision (with MySQL MEDIUMTEXT widening) + migration tests
- [ ] UPDATES.md entry if user-facing behavior changes

### Phase 2 — Backend removal
- [ ] Remove `explore_json` / `explore_json_data` / `generate_json` from `superset/views/core.py` (incl. CSV/XLSX/async branches)
- [ ] Remove CSRF exemption (`superset/config.py`) and GLOBAL_ASYNC_QUERIES explore_json path
- [ ] Delete `superset/viz.py`; unwind importers: `views/utils.py` (`get_viz`), `models/slice.py` (`Slice.viz`), `commands/chart/warm_up_cache.py`, `common/query_context_processor.py` (annotation path), `security/manager.py` (`BaseViz` overload)
- [ ] Delete `tests/unit_tests/test_viz_*.py`, `tests/integration_tests/viz_tests.py`
- [ ] Frontend plumbing: remove `useLegacyApi` from `ChartMetadata`, `shouldUseLegacyApi`, `/explore_json/` branches in `exploreUtils`, `chartAction.ts`, `ChartClient.ts`, `StatefulChart.tsx`, `DrillByModal.tsx`

### Phase 3 — Renames (folded into per-chart PRs where possible)
- [ ] `legacy-plugin-chart-*` → `plugin-chart-*` (dirs, npm names, `file:` deps, MainPreset imports, Storybook/docs)
- [ ] Resolve what remains of `legacy-preset-chart-nvd3` (bullet, time_pivot survivors)
- [ ] Drop "(legacy)" suffixes from user-facing chart names

## Log of work completed

(append entries as sub-PRs merge: date, sub-PR #, summary)

- 2026-07-02 — #41715 Phase 0 merged: removed orphaned `viz.py` classes
  (`MapboxViz`, `MapLibreViz`, `EventFlowViz`) and nvd3 BoxPlot leftovers.
- 2026-07-02 — #41716 `para` merged: buildQuery (series→columns, secondary
  metric alias, sort-metric append, explicit orderby ownership), 8 Jest tests.
- 2026-07-02 — #41717 `country_map` merged: buildQuery (entity+metric),
  country_id/metric rename in transformProps with both-labels guard, 15 tests.
- 2026-07-02 — #41718 `bullet` merged: buildQuery (single ungrouped metric),
  records→{measures} reshape in nvd3 transformProps Bullet branch, 5 tests.
- Open PRs: #41719 `chord`, #41720 `world_map`, #41721 `paired_ttest`,
  #41723 `time_table`.

- 2026-07-02 — Phase 0: removed orphaned `viz.py` classes (`MapboxViz`, `MapLibreViz`,
  `EventFlowViz`, −204 lines) and the unregistered nvd3 BoxPlot story leftovers.
  Verified: `ruff` clean, `tests/unit_tests/test_viz_*` pass.

## Decisions

- **compare** → migrating to `echarts_timeseries_line`; nvd3's interactive % rebasing is not preserved (flagged in UPDATES.md).
- **partition** → attempting convert-in-place; if the transformProps port proves unmaintainable, fall back to proposing deprecation on dev@.
- Feature branch lives on `apache/superset` so phase PRs can target it. Tracking files (SCOPE.md, UPDATES.md) are stripped before final merge.
- Tracking files are updated ONLY via direct commits to the feature branch (sub-PRs editing SCOPE.md all conflicted after the first squash-merge).
