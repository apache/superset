# Release Notes for Superset 4.1.0

Superset 4.1.0 brings a range of new features and quality of life improvements.  This release is a minor version, meaning it doesn't include any breaking changes to ensure a seamless transition for our users. Here are some of the highlights of this release.

### Big Number With Time Period Updates

We released a [Big Number with Time Period Comparison](https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/26908) chart as part of Superset 4.0. With the latest update, there are now [color options](https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/27524) for comparisons. The chart now also uses [standardize controls](https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/27193) such that when switching charts will maintain the selected metrics. To enable the new chart, you'll need to enable the `CHART_PLUGINS_EXPERIMENTAL` feature flag.

### Table with Time Comparison
Added functionality to do [table time comparisons](https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/28057) behind the `CHART_PLUGINS_EXPERIMENTAL` feature flag. This will help improve and facilitate efficient data analysis.

### New ECharts Versions

The new ECharts [Heatmap](https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/25353) has been added. Compared to the legacy Heatmap, it has more accurate percentage calculations, server side sorting to respect row limits, and a more interactive legend control that allows selecting a subset of values.

We also added a new ECharts [Histogram](https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/28652) chart. The new chart will help visualize patterns, clusters, and outliers in the data and provides insights into its shape, central tendency, and spread.

Both the [Heatmap](https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/27771) and [Histogram](https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/28780) migration logic have been added to the CLI if you wish to migrate ahead of time.

### Improved Upload Forms

We've made design changes to the [CSV](https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/27840), [Excel](https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/28105), and [Columnar](https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/28192
) upload modals to improve user experience and to be more performant. The new designs has the following goals:

- Improved error handling.
- Better backend parameter validation.
- More aligned with our other modal dialogs

### OAuth2 For Databases

You now have the ability to enable [OAuth2](https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/27631) for databases like BigQuery, Snowflake, Dremio, Databricks, Google Sheets, etc. When enabled, it will allow users to connect to Oauth2 enabled databases with their own credentials.

### Catalog Support For Databases

Added support for the [catalog heirachy](https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/28317) for databases that support it, such as [BigQuery (projects), Databricks, Presto, Snowflake, and Trino](https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/28416). Once enabled, users will see catalogs when selecting tables in [SQL Lab, datasets](https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/28376), and when setting up Data Access Roles
