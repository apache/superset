# Superset CLI Tests

This directory contains tests for the superset-cli package, focusing on the `init` command and other CLI functionality.

## Test Structure

### Core Test Files

- **`test_cli_init.py`**: Comprehensive tests for the `init` command scaffolder
- **`test_templates.py`**: Unit tests for Jinja2 template rendering
- **`conftest.py`**: Pytest fixtures and configuration
- **`utils.py`**: Reusable testing utilities and helpers

### Test Categories

#### Unit Tests (`@pytest.mark.unit`)

- Template rendering functionality
- Individual function testing
- Input validation logic

#### Integration Tests (`@pytest.mark.integration`)

- Complete CLI command workflows
- End-to-end scaffolding processes

#### CLI Tests (`@pytest.mark.cli`)

- Click command interface testing
- User input simulation
- Command output verification

## Testing Approach for Scaffolders/Generators

The tests use these patterns for testing code generators:

### 1. Isolated Environment Testing

```python
@pytest.fixture
def isolated_filesystem(tmp_path):
    """Provide isolated temporary directory for each test."""
```

### 2. Click CLI Testing Framework

```python
from click.testing import CliRunner
runner = CliRunner()
result = runner.invoke(app, ["init"], input="...")
```

### 3. File Structure Validation

```python
from tests.utils import assert_file_structure, assert_directory_structure
assert_file_structure(extension_path, expected_files)
```

### 4. Template Content Verification

```python
from tests.utils import assert_json_content
assert_json_content(json_path, {"name": "expected_value"})
```

### 5. Parametrized Testing

```python
@pytest.mark.parametrize("include_frontend,include_backend", [
    (True, True), (True, False), (False, True), (False, False)
])
```

## Key Test Cases

### Init Command Tests

- ✅ Creates extension with both frontend and backend
- ✅ Creates frontend-only extensions
- ✅ Creates backend-only extensions
- ✅ Validates extension naming (alphanumeric + underscore only)
- ✅ Handles existing directory conflicts
- ✅ Verifies generated file content accuracy
- ✅ Tests custom version and license inputs
- ✅ Integration test for complete workflow

### Template Rendering Tests

- ✅ Extension.json template with various configurations
- ✅ Package.json template rendering
- ✅ Pyproject.toml template rendering
- ✅ Template validation with different names/versions/licenses
- ✅ JSON validity verification
- ✅ Whitespace and formatting checks

## Running Tests

### All tests

```bash
pytest
```

### Specific test categories

```bash
pytest -m unit          # Unit tests only
pytest -m integration   # Integration tests only
pytest -m cli           # CLI tests only
```

### With coverage

```bash
pytest --cov=superset_cli --cov-report=html
```

### Specific test files

```bash
pytest tests/test_cli_init.py
pytest tests/test_templates.py
```

## Reusable Testing Infrastructure

The testing infrastructure is designed for reusability:

### Test Utilities (`tests/utils.py`)

- `assert_file_exists()` / `assert_directory_exists()`
- `assert_file_structure()` / `assert_directory_structure()`
- `assert_json_content()` / `load_json_file()`
- `create_test_extension_structure()` - Helper for expected structures

### Fixtures (`tests/conftest.py`)

- `cli_runner` - Click CLI runner
- `isolated_filesystem` - Temporary directory with cleanup
- `extension_params` - Default extension parameters
- `cli_input_*` - Pre-configured user inputs

This infrastructure can be easily extended for testing additional CLI commands like `build`, `bundle`, `dev`, and `validate`.

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **Isolation**: Each test runs in its own temporary directory
2. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Tests cover happy paths, edge cases, and error conditions
3. **Realistic Testing**: Uses actual Click CLI runner with realistic user input
4. **Content Verification**: Validates both file existence and content accuracy
5. **Template Testing**: Separates template rendering logic from CLI integration
6. **Reusable Components**: Utilities and fixtures designed for extension
7. **Clear Documentation**: Well-documented test cases and helper functions
8. **Type Safety**: Uses modern Python type annotations with `from __future__ import annotations`
