# 6.1.0

This release includes UX, performance, and security enhancements across the Table charts and the Remita Table plugin, plus configurability improvements for exports.

## Features / UX

- Core Table: Add “Server Search Match” Explore control when server pagination is enabled.
  - Default to Contains (ILIKE `%text%`); option to Prefix (ILIKE `text%`).
  - Includes performance hint to prefer Prefix on large datasets without specialized indexing.
- Remita Table: Add “Security & Embedding Notes” informational section in the control panel.

## Performance

- CSV streaming: Expose chunk size via `CSV_STREAMING_CHUNK_SIZE` (default 65536). Larger chunks improve throughput on large exports.
- Server search default: Contains now supported as default; guidance provided for using Prefix to leverage standard indexes.

## Security

- Backend feature flag `DISABLE_EXTRAS_WHERE` (default False) to strip client-provided `extras.where` from chart queries for high-security environments.
- Remita Table actions: Enforce same-origin by default; cross-origin allowed only when the origin is in `REMITA_TABLE_ALLOWED_ACTION_ORIGINS`.
- Dev-only: Recognize wildcard `'*'` in `REMITA_TABLE_ALLOWED_ACTION_ORIGINS` to allow all origins during development and examples.
- Remita embedded messaging: Restrict `postMessage` to same-origin or allowlisted parent origins.

## Documentation

- Updated Remita Table guide with allowlist, embedding/postMessage rules, and server search behavior.
- Updated Decisions to reflect “contains by default” for server-side Table search.
- New Configuration Keys reference for:
  - `REMITA_TABLE_ALLOWED_ACTION_ORIGINS`
  - `DISABLE_EXTRAS_WHERE`
  - `CSV_STREAMING_CHUNK_SIZE`
  - Core Table “Server Search Match” behavior

## Tests

- Added unit test to assert streaming CSV uses `CSV_STREAMING_CHUNK_SIZE`.
- Added integration test verifying invalid `extras.where` is stripped when `DISABLE_EXTRAS_WHERE=True`.
