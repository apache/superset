Description: 
        **pandas** is a Python package providing fast, flexible, and expressive data
        structures designed to make working with structured (tabular, multidimensional,
        potentially heterogeneous) and time series data both easy and intuitive. It
        aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for doing practical,
        **real world** data analysis in Python. Additionally, it has the broader goal
        of becoming **the most powerful and flexible open source data analysis /
        manipulation tool available in any language**. It is already well on its way
        toward this goal.
        
        pandas is well suited for many different kinds of data:
        
          - Tabular data with heterogeneously-typed columns, as in an SQL table or
            Excel spreadsheet
          - Ordered and unordered (not necessarily fixed-frequency) time series data.
          - Arbitrary matrix data (homogeneously typed or heterogeneous) with row and
            column labels
          - Any other form of observational / statistical data sets. The data actually
            need not be labeled at all to be placed into a pandas data structure
        
        The two primary data structures of pandas, Series (1-dimensional) and DataFrame
        (2-dimensional), handle the vast majority of typical use cases in finance,
        statistics, social science, and many areas of engineering. For R users,
        DataFrame provides everything that R's ``data.frame`` provides and much
        more. pandas is built on top of `NumPy <http://www.numpy.org>`__ and is
        intended to integrate well within a scientific computing environment with many
        other 3rd party libraries.
        
        Here are just a few of the things that pandas does well:
        
          - Easy handling of **missing data** (represented as NaN) in floating point as
            well as non-floating point data
          - Size mutability: columns can be **inserted and deleted** from DataFrame and
            higher dimensional objects
          - Automatic and explicit **data alignment**: objects can be explicitly
            aligned to a set of labels, or the user can simply ignore the labels and
            let `Series`, `DataFrame`, etc. automatically align the data for you in
            computations
          - Powerful, flexible **group by** functionality to perform
            split-apply-combine operations on data sets, for both aggregating and
            transforming data
          - Make it **easy to convert** ragged, differently-indexed data in other
            Python and NumPy data structures into DataFrame objects
          - Intelligent label-based **slicing**, **fancy indexing**, and **subsetting**
            of large data sets
          - Intuitive **merging** and **joining** data sets
          - Flexible **reshaping** and pivoting of data sets
          - **Hierarchical** labeling of axes (possible to have multiple labels per
            tick)
          - Robust IO tools for loading data from **flat files** (CSV and delimited),
            Excel files, databases, and saving / loading data from the ultrafast **HDF5
            format**
          - **Time series**-specific functionality: date range generation and frequency
            conversion, moving window statistics, moving window linear regressions,
            date shifting and lagging, etc.
        
        Many of these principles are here to address the shortcomings frequently
        experienced using other languages / scientific research environments. For data
        scientists, working with data is typically divided into multiple stages:
        munging and cleaning data, analyzing / modeling it, then organizing the results
        of the analysis into a form suitable for plotting or tabular display. pandas is
        the ideal tool for all of these tasks.
