Overview
========



A fast and thorough lazy object proxy.

* Free software: BSD license

Note that this is based on `wrapt`_'s ObjectProxy with one big change: it calls a function the first time the proxy object is
used, while `wrapt.ObjectProxy` just forwards the method calls to the target object.

In other words, you use `lazy-object-proxy` when you only have the object way later and you use `wrapt.ObjectProxy` when you
want to override few methods (by subclassing) and forward everything else to the target object.

Example::

    def expensive_func():
        # create expensive object
        return stuff

    obj = lazy_object_proxy.Proxy(expensive_func)
    # function is called only when object is actually used
    print(obj.foobar)  # now expensive_func is called

Installation
============

::

    pip install lazy-object-proxy

Acknowledgements
================

This project is based on some code from `wrapt`_ as you can see in the git history.

Changelog
=========

1.3.1 (2017-05-05)
------------------

* Fix broken release (``sdist`` had a broken ``MANIFEST.in``).

1.3.0 (2017-05-02)
------------------

* Speed up arithmetic operations involving ``cext.Proxy`` subclasses.

1.2.2 (2016-04-14)
------------------

* Added `manylinux <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0513/>`_ wheels.
* Minor cleanup in readme.

1.2.1 (2015-08-18)
------------------

* Fix a memory leak (the wrapped object would get bogus references). Contributed by Astrum Kuo in
  `#10 <https://github.com/ionelmc/python-lazy-object-proxy/pull/10>`_.

1.2.0 (2015-07-06)
------------------

* Don't instantiate the object when __repr__ is called. This aids with debugging (allows one to see exactly in
  what state the proxy is).

1.1.0 (2015-07-05)
------------------

* Added support for pickling. The pickled value is going to be the wrapped object *without* any Proxy container.
* Fixed a memory management issue in the C extension (reference cycles weren't garbage collected due to improper
  handling in the C extension). Contributed by Alvin Chow in
  `#8 <https://github.com/ionelmc/python-lazy-object-proxy/pull/8>`_.

1.0.2 (2015-04-11)
-----------------------------------------

* First release on PyPI.
