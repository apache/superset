Description: NumPy is a general-purpose array-processing package designed to
        efficiently manipulate large multi-dimensional arrays of arbitrary
        records without sacrificing too much speed for small multi-dimensional
        arrays.  NumPy is built on the Numeric code base and adds features
        introduced by numarray as well as an extended C-API and the ability to
        create arrays of arbitrary type which also makes NumPy suitable for
        interfacing with general-purpose data-base applications.
        
        There are also basic facilities for discrete fourier transform,
        basic linear algebra and random number generation.
        
        All numpy wheels distributed from pypi are BSD licensed.
        
        Windows wheels are linked against the ATLAS BLAS / LAPACK library, restricted
        to SSE2 instructions, so may not give optimal linear algebra performance for
        your machine. See http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/install.html for
        alternatives.
