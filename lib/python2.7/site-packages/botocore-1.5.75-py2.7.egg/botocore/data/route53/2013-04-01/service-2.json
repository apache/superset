For example, you can use <code>ChangeResourceRecordSets</code> to create a resource record set that routes traffic for test.example.com to a web server that has an IP address of 192.0.2.44.</p> <p> <b>Change Batches and Transactional Changes</b> </p> <p>The request body must include a document with a <code>ChangeResourceRecordSetsRequest</code> element. The request body contains a list of change items, known as a change batch. Change batches are considered transactional changes. When using the Amazon Route 53 API to change resource record sets, Amazon Route 53 either makes all or none of the changes in a change batch request. This ensures that Amazon Route 53 never partially implements the intended changes to the resource record sets in a hosted zone. </p> <p>For example, a change batch request that deletes the <code>CNAME</code> record for www.example.com and creates an alias resource record set for www.example.com. Amazon Route 53 deletes the first resource record set and creates the second resource record set in a single operation. If either the <code>DELETE</code> or the <code>CREATE</code> action fails, then both changes (plus any other changes in the batch) fail, and the original <code>CNAME</code> record continues to exist.</p> <important> <p>Due to the nature of transactional changes, you can't delete the same resource record set more than once in a single change batch. If you attempt to delete the same change batch more than once, Amazon Route 53 returns an <code>InvalidChangeBatch</code> error.</p> </important> <p> <b>Traffic Flow</b> </p> <p>To create resource record sets for complex routing configurations, use either the traffic flow visual editor in the Amazon Route 53 console or the API actions for traffic policies and traffic policy instances. Save the configuration as a traffic policy, then associate the traffic policy with one or more domain names (such as example.com) or subdomain names (such as www.example.com), in the same hosted zone or in multiple hosted zones. You can roll back the updates if the new configuration isn't performing as expected.

If a resource set does exist, Amazon Route 53 updates it with the values in the request. </p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Syntaxes for Creating, Updating, and Deleting Resource Record Sets</b> </p> <p>The syntax for a request depends on the type of resource record set that you want to create, delete, or update, such as weighted, alias, or failover. The XML elements in your request must appear in the order listed in the syntax. </p> <p>For an example for each type of resource record set, see \"Examples.\"</p> <p>Don't refer to the syntax in the \"Parameter Syntax\" section, which includes all of the elements for every kind of resource record set that you can create, delete, or update by using <code>ChangeResourceRecordSets</code>. </p> <p> <b>Change Propagation to Amazon Route 53 DNS Servers</b> </p> <p>When you submit a <code>ChangeResourceRecordSets</code> request, Amazon Route 53 propagates your changes to all of the Amazon Route 53 authoritative DNS servers.

Configuring health checks only makes sense in the following configurations:</p> <ul> <li> <p>You're checking the health of the resource record sets in a group of weighted, latency, geolocation, or failover resource record sets, and you specify health check IDs for all of the resource record sets. If the health check for one resource record set specifies an endpoint that is not healthy, Amazon Route 53 stops responding to queries using the value for that resource record set.</p> </li> <li> <p>You set <code>EvaluateTargetHealth</code> to true for the resource record sets in a group of alias, weighted alias, latency alias, geolocation alias, or failover alias resource record sets, and you specify health check IDs for all of the resource record sets that are referenced by the alias resource record sets.</p> </li> </ul> <important> <p>Amazon Route 53 doesn't check the health of the endpoint specified in the resource record set, for example, the endpoint specified by the IP address in the <code>Value</code> element. When you add a <code>HealthCheckId</code> element to a resource record set, Amazon Route 53 checks the health of the endpoint that you specified in the health check. </p> </important> <p>For geolocation resource record sets, if an endpoint is unhealthy, Amazon Route 53 looks for a resource record set for the larger, associated geographic region. For example, suppose you have resource record sets for a state in the United States, for the United States, for North America, and for all locations. If the endpoint for the state resource record set is unhealthy, Amazon Route 53 checks the resource record sets for the United States, for North America, and for all locations (a resource record set for which the value of <code>CountryCode</code> is <code>*</code>), in that order, until it finds a resource record set for which the endpoint is healthy. </p> <p>If your health checks specify the endpoint only by domain name, we recommend that you create a separate health check for each endpoint. For example, create a health check for each <code>HTTP</code> server that is serving content for <code>www.example.com</code>. For the value of <code>FullyQualifiedDomainName</code>, specify the domain name of the server (such as <code>us-east-2-www.example.com</code>), not the name of the resource record sets (example.com).</p> <important> <p>n this configuration, if you create a health check for which the value of <code>FullyQualifiedDomainName</code> matches the name of the resource record sets and then associate the health check with those resource record sets, health check results will be unpredictable.</p> </important> <p>For more information, see the following topics in the <i>Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide</i>:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover.html\">Amazon Route 53 Health Checks and DNS Failover</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-private-hosted-zones.html\">Configuring Failover in a Private Hosted Zone</a> </p> </li> </ul>"
