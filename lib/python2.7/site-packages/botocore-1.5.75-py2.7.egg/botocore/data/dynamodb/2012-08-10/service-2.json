If the attribute already exists, it is replaced by the new value. </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>DELETE</code> - If no value is specified, the attribute and its value are removed from the item. The data type of the specified value must match the existing value's data type.</p> <p>If a <i>set</i> of values is specified, then those values are subtracted from the old set. For example, if the attribute value was the set <code>[a,b,c]</code> and the <code>DELETE</code> action specified <code>[a,c]</code>, then the final attribute value would be <code>[b]</code>. Specifying an empty set is an error.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>ADD</code> - If the attribute does not already exist, then the attribute and its values are added to the item. If the attribute does exist, then the behavior of <code>ADD</code> depends on the data type of the attribute:</p> <ul> <li> <p>If the existing attribute is a number, and if <code>Value</code> is also a number, then the <code>Value</code> is mathematically added to the existing attribute. If <code>Value</code> is a negative number, then it is subtracted from the existing attribute.</p> <note> <p> If you use <code>ADD</code> to increment or decrement a number value for an item that doesn't exist before the update, DynamoDB uses 0 as the initial value.</p> <p>In addition, if you use <code>ADD</code> to update an existing item, and intend to increment or decrement an attribute value which does not yet exist, DynamoDB uses <code>0</code> as the initial value. For example, suppose that the item you want to update does not yet have an attribute named <i>itemcount</i>, but you decide to <code>ADD</code> the number <code>3</code> to this attribute anyway, even though it currently does not exist. DynamoDB will create the <i>itemcount</i> attribute, set its initial value to <code>0</code>, and finally add <code>3</code> to it. The result will be a new <i>itemcount</i> attribute in the item, with a value of <code>3</code>.</p> </note> </li> <li> <p>If the existing data type is a set, and if the <code>Value</code> is also a set, then the <code>Value</code> is added to the existing set. (This is a <i>set</i> operation, not mathematical addition.) For example, if the attribute value was the set <code>[1,2]</code>, and the <code>ADD</code> action specified <code>[3]</code>, then the final attribute value would be <code>[1,2,3]</code>. An error occurs if an Add action is specified for a set attribute and the attribute type specified does not match the existing set type. </p> <p>Both sets must have the same primitive data type. For example, if the existing data type is a set of strings, the <code>Value</code> must also be a set of strings. The same holds true for number sets and binary sets.</p> </li> </ul> <p>This action is only valid for an existing attribute whose data type is number or is a set.

If any of these attribute already exist, they are replaced by the new values. You can also use <code>SET</code> to add or subtract from an attribute that is of type Number. For example: <code>SET myNum = myNum + :val</code> </p> <p> <code>SET</code> supports the following functions:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>if_not_exists (path, operand)</code> - if the item does not contain an attribute at the specified path, then <code>if_not_exists</code> evaluates to operand; otherwise, it evaluates to path. You can use this function to avoid overwriting an attribute that may already be present in the item.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>list_append (operand, operand)</code> - evaluates to a list with a new element added to it. You can append the new element to the start or the end of the list by reversing the order of the operands.</p> </li> </ul> <p>These function names are case-sensitive.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>REMOVE</code> - Removes one or more attributes from an item.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>ADD</code> - Adds the specified value to the item, if the attribute does not already exist. If the attribute does exist, then the behavior of <code>ADD</code> depends on the data type of the attribute:</p> <ul> <li> <p>If the existing attribute is a number, and if <code>Value</code> is also a number, then <code>Value</code> is mathematically added to the existing attribute. If <code>Value</code> is a negative number, then it is subtracted from the existing attribute.</p> <note> <p>If you use <code>ADD</code> to increment or decrement a number value for an item that doesn't exist before the update, DynamoDB uses <code>0</code> as the initial value.</p> <p>Similarly, if you use <code>ADD</code> for an existing item to increment or decrement an attribute value that doesn't exist before the update, DynamoDB uses <code>0</code> as the initial value. For example, suppose that the item you want to update doesn't have an attribute named <i>itemcount</i>, but you decide to <code>ADD</code> the number <code>3</code> to this attribute anyway. DynamoDB will create the <i>itemcount</i> attribute, set its initial value to <code>0</code>, and finally add <code>3</code> to it. The result will be a new <i>itemcount</i> attribute in the item, with a value of <code>3</code>.</p> </note> </li> <li> <p>If the existing data type is a set and if <code>Value</code> is also a set, then <code>Value</code> is added to the existing set. For example, if the attribute value is the set <code>[1,2]</code>, and the <code>ADD</code> action specified <code>[3]</code>, then the final attribute value is <code>[1,2,3]</code>. An error occurs if an <code>ADD</code> action is specified for a set attribute and the attribute type specified does not match the existing set type. </p> <p>Both sets must have the same primitive data type. For example, if the existing data type is a set of strings, the <code>Value</code> must also be a set of strings.</p> </li> </ul> <important> <p>The <code>ADD</code> action only supports Number and set data types.
