To determine when a job is complete, you have the following options:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <b>Use Amazon SNS Notification</b> You can specify an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic to which Amazon Glacier can post a notification after the job is completed. You can specify an SNS topic per job request. The notification is sent only after Amazon Glacier completes the job. In addition to specifying an SNS topic per job request, you can configure vault notifications for a vault so that job notifications are always sent. For more information, see <a>SetVaultNotifications</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Get job details</b> You can make a <a>DescribeJob</a> request to obtain job status information while a job is in progress. However, it is more efficient to use an Amazon SNS notification to determine when a job is complete.</p> </li> </ul> <note> <p>The information you get via notification is same that you get by calling <a>DescribeJob</a>.</p> </note> <p>If for a specific event, you add both the notification configuration on the vault and also specify an SNS topic in your initiate job request, Amazon Glacier sends both notifications. For more information, see <a>SetVaultNotifications</a>.</p> <p>An AWS account has full permission to perform all operations (actions). However, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users don't have any permissions by default. You must grant them explicit permission to perform specific actions. For more information, see <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/using-iam-with-amazon-glacier.html\">Access Control Using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)</a>.</p> <p> <b>About the Vault Inventory</b> </p> <p>Amazon Glacier prepares an inventory for each vault periodically, every 24 hours. When you initiate a job for a vault inventory, Amazon Glacier returns the last inventory for the vault. The inventory data you get might be up to a day or two days old. Also, the initiate inventory job might take some time to complete before you can download the vault inventory. So you do not want to retrieve a vault inventory for each vault operation. However, in some scenarios, you might find the vault inventory useful. For example, when you upload an archive, you can provide an archive description but not an archive name. Amazon Glacier provides you a unique archive ID, an opaque string of characters. So, you might maintain your own database that maps archive names to their corresponding Amazon Glacier assigned archive IDs. You might find the vault inventory useful in the event you need to reconcile information in your database with the actual vault inventory.</p> <p> <b>Range Inventory Retrieval</b> </p> <p>You can limit the number of inventory items retrieved by filtering on the archive creation date or by setting a limit.</p> <p> <i>Filtering by Archive Creation Date</i> </p> <p>You can retrieve inventory items for archives created between <code>StartDate</code> and <code>EndDate</code> by specifying values for these parameters in the <b>InitiateJob</b> request. Archives created on or after the <code>StartDate</code> and before the <code>EndDate</code> will be returned. If you only provide the <code>StartDate</code> without the <code>EndDate</code>, you will retrieve the inventory for all archives created on or after the <code>StartDate</code>. If you only provide the <code>EndDate</code> without the <code>StartDate</code>, you will get back the inventory for all archives created before the <code>EndDate</code>.</p> <p> <i>Limiting Inventory Items per Retrieval</i> </p> <p>You can limit the number of inventory items returned by setting the <code>Limit</code> parameter in the <b>InitiateJob</b> request. The inventory job output will contain inventory items up to the specified <code>Limit</code>. If there are more inventory items available, the result is paginated. After a job is complete you can use the <a>DescribeJob</a> operation to get a marker that you use in a subsequent <b>InitiateJob</b> request. The marker will indicate the starting point to retrieve the next set of inventory items. You can page through your entire inventory by repeatedly making <b>InitiateJob</b> requests with the marker from the previous <b>DescribeJob</b> output, until you get a marker from <b>DescribeJob</b> that returns null, indicating that there are no more inventory items available.</p> <p>You can use the <code>Limit</code> parameter together with the date range parameters.</p> <p> <b>About Ranged Archive Retrieval</b> </p> <p>You can initiate an archive retrieval for the whole archive or a range of the archive. In the case of ranged archive retrieval, you specify a byte range to return or the whole archive. The range specified must be megabyte (MB) aligned, that is the range start value must be divisible by 1 MB and range end value plus 1 must be divisible by 1 MB or equal the end of the archive. If the ranged archive retrieval is not megabyte aligned, this operation returns a 400 response. Furthermore, to ensure you get checksum values for data you download using Get Job Output API, the range must be tree hash aligned.</p> <p>An AWS account has full permission to perform all operations (actions). However, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users don't have any permissions by default. You must grant them explicit permission to perform specific actions.

Standard retrievals typically complete within 3–5 hours.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Bulk</b> Amazon Glacier’s lowest-cost retrieval option, which enables you to retrieve large amounts of data inexpensively in a day. Bulk retrieval requests typically complete within 5–12 hours. </p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Expedited</b> Amazon Glacier’s option for the fastest retrievals. Archives requested using the expedited retrievals typically become accessible within 1–5 minutes. </p> </li> </ul> <p>For more information about expedited and bulk retrievals, see <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/downloading-an-archive-two-steps.html\">Retrieving Amazon Glacier Archives</a>.</p>"

  "documentation":"<p>Amazon Glacier is a storage solution for \"cold data.\"</p> <p>Amazon Glacier is an extremely low-cost storage service that provides secure, durable, and easy-to-use storage for data backup and archival. With Amazon Glacier, customers can store their data cost effectively for months, years, or decades. Amazon Glacier also enables customers to offload the administrative burdens of operating and scaling storage to AWS, so they don't have to worry about capacity planning, hardware provisioning, data replication, hardware failure and recovery, or time-consuming hardware migrations.</p> <p>Amazon Glacier is a great storage choice when low storage cost is paramount, your data is rarely retrieved, and retrieval latency of several hours is acceptable. If your application requires fast or frequent access to your data, consider using Amazon S3. For more information, see <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/s3/\">Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)</a>.</p> <p>You can store any kind of data in any format. There is no maximum limit on the total amount of data you can store in Amazon Glacier.</p> <p>If you are a first-time user of Amazon Glacier, we recommend that you begin by reading the following sections in the <i>Amazon Glacier Developer Guide</i>:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/introduction.html\">What is Amazon Glacier</a> - This section of the Developer Guide describes the underlying data model, the operations it supports, and the AWS SDKs that you can use to interact with the service.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/amazon-glacier-getting-started.html\">Getting Started with Amazon Glacier</a> - The Getting Started section walks you through the process of creating a vault, uploading archives, creating jobs to download archives, retrieving the job output, and deleting archives.</p> </li> </ul>"
