========
 Flake8
========

Flake8 is a wrapper around these tools:

- PyFlakes
- pycodestyle
- Ned Batchelder's McCabe script

Flake8 runs all the tools by launching the single ``flake8`` command.
It displays the warnings in a per-file, merged output.

It also adds a few features:

- files that contain this line are skipped::

    # flake8: noqa

- lines that contain a ``# noqa`` comment at the end will not issue warnings.
- you can ignore specific errors on a line with ``# noqa: <error>``, e.g.,
  ``# noqa: E234``
- Git and Mercurial hooks
- extendable through ``flake8.extension`` and ``flake8.formatting`` entry
  points


Quickstart
==========

See our `quickstart documentation
<http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/index.html#quickstart>`_ for how to install
