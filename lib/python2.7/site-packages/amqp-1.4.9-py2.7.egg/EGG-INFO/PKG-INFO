        About
        =====
        
        This is a fork of amqplib_ which was originally written by Barry Pederson.
        It is maintained by the Celery_ project, and used by `kombu`_ as a pure python
        alternative when `librabbitmq`_ is not available.
        
        This library should be API compatible with `librabbitmq`_.

        Differences from `amqplib`_
        ===========================
        
        - Supports draining events from multiple channels (``Connection.drain_events``)
        - Support for timeouts
        - Channels are restored after channel error, instead of having to close the
          connection.
        - Support for heartbeats
        
            - ``Connection.heartbeat_tick(rate=2)`` must called at regular intervals
              (half of the heartbeat value if rate is 2).
            - Or some other scheme by using ``Connection.send_heartbeat``.
        - Supports RabbitMQ extensions:
            - Consumer Cancel Notifications
                - by default a cancel results in ``ChannelError`` being raised
                - but not if a ``on_cancel`` callback is passed to ``basic_consume``.
            - Publisher confirms
                - ``Channel.confirm_select()`` enables publisher confirms.
                - ``Channel.events['basic_ack'].append(my_callback)`` adds a callback
                  to be called when a message is confirmed. This callback is then
                  called with the signature ``(delivery_tag, multiple)``.
            - Exchange-to-exchange bindings: ``exchange_bind`` / ``exchange_unbind``.
                - ``Channel.confirm_select()`` enables publisher confirms.
                - ``Channel.events['basic_ack'].append(my_callback)`` adds a callback
                  to be called when a message is confirmed. This callback is then
                  called with the signature ``(delivery_tag, multiple)``.
        - Support for ``basic_return``
        - Uses AMQP 0-9-1 instead of 0-8.
            - ``Channel.access_request`` and ``ticket`` arguments to methods
              **removed**.
            - Supports the ``arguments`` argument to ``basic_consume``.
            - ``internal`` argument to ``exchange_declare`` removed.
            - ``auto_delete`` argument to ``exchange_declare`` deprecated
            - ``insist`` argument to ``Connection`` removed.
            - ``Channel.alerts`` has been removed.
            - Support for ``Channel.basic_recover_async``.
            - ``Channel.basic_recover`` deprecated.
        - Exceptions renamed to have idiomatic names:
            - ``AMQPException`` -> ``AMQPError``
            - ``AMQPConnectionException`` -> ConnectionError``
            - ``AMQPChannelException`` -> ChannelError``
            - ``Connection.known_hosts`` removed.
            - ``Connection`` no longer supports redirects.
            - ``exchange`` argument to ``queue_bind`` can now be empty
              to use the "default exchange".
        - Adds ``Connection.is_alive`` that tries to detect
          whether the connection can still be used.
        - Adds ``Connection.connection_errors`` and ``.channel_errors``,
          a list of recoverable errors.
        - Exposes the underlying socket as ``Connection.sock``.
        - Adds ``Channel.no_ack_consumers`` to keep track of consumer tags
          that set the no_ack flag.
        - Slightly better at error recovery
