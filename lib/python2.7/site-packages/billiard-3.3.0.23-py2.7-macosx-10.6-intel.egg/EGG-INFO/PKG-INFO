        About
        -----
        
        `billiard` is a fork of the Python 2.7 `multiprocessing <http://docs.python.org/library/multiprocessing.html>`_
        package. The multiprocessing package itself is a renamed and updated version of
        R Oudkerk's `pyprocessing <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/processing/>`_ package.
        This standalone variant is intended to be compatible with Python 2.4 and 2.5,
        and will draw it's fixes/improvements from python-trunk.
        
        - This package would not be possible if not for the contributions of not only
          the current maintainers but all of the contributors to the original pyprocessing
          package listed `here <http://pyprocessing.berlios.de/doc/THANKS.html>`_
        
        - Also it is a fork of the multiprocessin backport package by Christian Heims.
        
        - It includes the no-execv patch contributed by R. Oudkerk.
        
        - And the Pool improvements previously located in `Celery`_.

        - Pool: Timeouts will attempt to send SIGKILL, but this signal
          does not exist on Windows.  Replaced with SIGTERM.
        
        3.3.0.19 - 2014-10-13
        ---------------------
        
        - Pool: Exceptions in user timeout callbacks are now logged instead
          of crashing the pool.
        
            Contributed by Pierre Fersing.
        
        - Pool: Exit codes in errors were improperly being represented as signals.

            Contributed by Michael Fladischer.
        
        - Pool: `AF_PIPE` address fixed so that it works on recent Windows versions
          in combination with Python 2.7.7.

        3.3.0.17 - 2014-04-16
        ---------------------
        
        - Fixes SemLock on Python 3.4 (Issue #107) when using
          ``forking_enable(False)``.
        
        - Pool: Include more useful exitcode information when processes exit.
        
        3.3.0.16 - 2014-02-11
        ---------------------
        
        - Previous release was missing the billiard.py3 package from MANIFEST
          so the installation would not work on Python 3.
        
        3.3.0.15 - 2014-02-10
        ---------------------
        
        - Pool: Fixed "cannot join process not started" error.
        
        - Now uses billiard.py2 and billiard.py3 specific packages that are installed
          depending on the python version used.
        
            This way the installation will not import version specific modules (and
            possibly crash).
        
        3.3.0.14 - 2014-01-17
        ---------------------

        3.3.0.13 - 2013-12-13
        ---------------------
        
        - Fixes compatability with Python < 2.7.6
        
        - No longer attempts to handle ``SIGBUS``
        
            Contributed by Vishal Vatsa.
        
        - Non-thread based pool now only handles signals:
        
            ``SIGHUP``, ``SIGQUIT``, ``SIGTERM``, ``SIGUSR1``,
            ``SIGUSR2``.
        
        - setup.py: Only show compilation warning for build related commands.
        
        3.3.0.12 - 2013-12-09
        ---------------------

        ---------------------
        
        - Fixed Unicode error when installing the distribution (Issue #89).
        
        - Daemonic processes are now allowed to have children.
        
            But note that it will not be possible to automatically
            terminate them when the process exits.
        
            See discussion at https://github.com/celery/celery/issues/1709
        
        - Pool:  Would not always be able to detect that a process exited.
        
        
        3.3.0.10 - 2013-12-02
        ---------------------
        
        - Windows: Fixed problem with missing ``WAITABANDONED_0``
        
            Fix contributed by Matthias Wagner

            Fix contributed by Ionel Cristian Maries.
        
        3.3.0.8 - 2013-11-21
        --------------------
        
        - Now also sets ``multiprocessing.current_process`` for compatibility
          with loggings ``processName`` field.
        
        3.3.0.7 - 2013-11-15
        --------------------
        
        - Fixed compatibility with PyPy 2.1 + 2.2.
        
        - Fixed problem in pypy detection.
        
            Fix contributed by Tin Tvrtkovic.
        
        - Now uses ``ctypes.find_library`` instead of hardcoded path to find
          the OS X CoreServices framework.
        
            Fix contributed by Moritz Kassner.
        
        
        3.3.0.6 - 2013-11-12
        --------------------
        
        - Now works without C extension again.
        
        - New ``_billiard.read(fd, buffer, [len, ])`` function
          implements os.read with buffer support (new buffer API)
        
        - New pure-python implementation of ``Connection.send_offset``.
        
        3.3.0.5 - 2013-11-11
        --------------------
        
        - All platforms except for Windows/PyPy/Jython now requires the C extension.
        
        3.3.0.4 - 2013-11-11

        - Fixed problem with Python3 and setblocking.
        
        3.3.0.3 - 2013-11-09
        --------------------
        
        - Now works on Windows again.
        
        3.3.0.2 - 2013-11-08
        --------------------
        
        - ApplyResult.terminate() may be set to signify that the job
          must not be executed.  It can be used in combination with
          Pool.terminate_job.
        
        - Pipe/_SimpleQueue: Now supports rnonblock/wnonblock arguments
          to set the read or write end of the pipe to be nonblocking.
        
        - Pool: Log message included exception info but exception happened
          in another process so the resulting traceback was wrong.
        
        - Pool: Worker process can now prepare results before they are sent
          back to the main process (using ``Worker.prepare_result``).
        
        3.3.0.1 - 2013-11-04
        --------------------
        
        - Pool: New ``correlation_id`` argument to ``apply_async`` can be
          used to set a related id for the ``ApplyResult`` object returned:
        
            >>> r = pool.apply_async(target, args, kwargs, correlation_id='foo')
            >>> r.correlation_id
            'foo'
        
        - Pool: New callback `on_process_exit` is called when a pool
          process exits, with signature ``(pid, exitcode)``.
        
            Contributed by Daniel M. Taub.
        
        - Pool: Improved the too many restarts detection.
        
        3.3.0.0 - 2013-10-14
        --------------------
        
        - Dual code base now runs on Python 2.6+ and Python 3.
        
        - No longer compatible with Python 2.5
        
        - Includes many changes from multiprocessing in 3.4.
        
        - Now uses ``time.monotonic`` when available, also including
          fallback implementations for Linux and OS X.
        
        - No longer cleans up after receiving SIGILL, SIGSEGV or SIGFPE
        
            Contributed by Kevin Blackham
        
        - ``Finalize`` and ``register_after_fork`` is now aliases to multiprocessing.
        
            It's better to import these from multiprocessing directly now
            so that there aren't multiple registries.
        
        - New `billiard.queues._SimpleQueue` that does not use semaphores.
        
        - Pool: Can now be extended to support using multiple IPC queues.
        
        - Pool: Can now use async I/O to write to pool IPC queues.
        
        - Pool: New ``Worker.on_loop_stop`` handler can be used to add actions
          at pool worker process shutdown.
        
            Note that, like all finalization handlers, there is no guarantee that
            this will be executed.

        2.7.3.29 - 2013-06-28
        ---------------------
        
        - Compilation: Fixed improper handling of HAVE_SEM_OPEN (Issue #55)
        
            Fix contributed by Krzysztof Jagiello.
        
        - Process now releases logging locks after fork.
        
            This previously happened in Pool, but it was done too late
            as processes logs when they bootstrap.
        
        - Pool.terminate_job now ignores `No such process` errors.
        
        - billiard.Pool entrypoint did not support new arguments
          to billiard.pool.Pool
        
        - Connection inbound buffer size increased from 1kb to 128kb.
        
        - C extension cleaned up by properly adding a namespace to symbols.
        
        - _exit_function now works even if thread wakes up after gc collect.
        
        2.7.3.28 - 2013-04-16
        ---------------------
        
        - Pool: Fixed regression that disabled the deadlock
          fix in 2.7.3.24
        
        - Pool: RestartFreqExceeded could be raised prematurely.
        
        - Process: Include pid in startup and process INFO logs.
        
        2.7.3.27 - 2013-04-12
        ---------------------
        
        - Manager now works again.
        
        - Python 3 fixes for billiard.connection.
        
        - Fixed invalid argument bug when running on Python 3.3
        
            Fix contributed by Nathan Wan.
        
        - Ignore OSError when setting up signal handlers.
        
        2.7.3.26 - 2013-04-09
        ---------------------
        
        - Pool: Child processes must ignore SIGINT.
        
        2.7.3.25 - 2013-04-09
        ---------------------
        
        - Pool: 2.7.3.24 broke support for subprocesses (Issue #48).
        
            Signals that should be ignored were instead handled
            by terminating.
        
        2.7.3.24 - 2013-04-08
        ---------------------
        
        - Pool:  Make sure finally blocks are called when process exits
          due to a signal.
        
            This fixes a deadlock problem when the process is killed
            while having acquired the shared semaphore.  However, this solution
            does not protect against the processes being killed, a more elaborate
            solution is required for that. Hopefully this will be fixed soon in a
            later version.
        
        - Pool:  Can now use GDB to debug pool child processes.
        
        - Fixes Python 3 compatibility problems.
        
            Contributed by Albertas Agejevas.
        
        2.7.3.23 - 2013-03-22
        ---------------------
        
        - Windows: Now catches SystemExit from setuptools while trying to build
          the C extension (Issue #41).
        
        2.7.3.22 - 2013-03-08
        ---------------------
        
        - Pool: apply_async now supports a ``callbacks_propagate`` keyword
          argument that can be a tuple of exceptions to propagate in callbacks.
          (callback, errback, accept_callback, timeout_callback).
        
        - Errors are no longer logged for OK and recycle exit codes.
        
            This would cause normal maxtasksperchild recycled process
            to log an error.
        
        - Fixed Python 2.5 compatibility problem (Issue #33).
        
        - FreeBSD: Compilation now disables semaphores if Python was built
          without it (Issue #40).
        
            Contributed by William Grzybowski
        
        2.7.3.21 - 2013-02-11
        ---------------------
        
        - Fixed typo EX_REUSE -> EX_RECYCLE
        
        - Code now conforms to new pep8.py rules.
        
        2.7.3.20 - 2013-02-08
        ---------------------
        
        - Pool: Disable restart limit if maxR is not set.
        
        - Pool: Now uses os.kill instead of signal.signal.
        
            Contributed by Lukasz Langa
        
        - Fixed name error in process.py
        
        - Pool: ApplyResult.get now properly raises exceptions.
        
            Fix contributed by xentac.
        
        2.7.3.19 - 2012-11-30
        ---------------------
        
        - Fixes problem at shutdown when gc has collected symbols.
        
        - Pool now always uses _kill for Py2.5 compatibility on Windows (Issue #32).

            Code.frame.__loader__ is now ignored as it may be set to
            an unpickleable object.
        
        - The Django old-layout warning was always showing.
        
        2.7.3.17 - 2012-09-26
        ---------------------
        
        - Fixes typo

        - Windows: Fixes for SemLock._rebuild (Issue #24).
        
        - Pool: Job terminated with terminate_job now raises
          billiard.exceptions.Terminated.

        ---------------------
        
        - Installation now works again for Python 3.
        
        2.7.3.13 - 2012-09-14
        ---------------------
        
        - Merged with Python trunk (many authors, many fixes: see Python changelog in
          trunk).
        
        - Using execv now also works with older Django projects using setup_environ
          (Issue #10).
        
        - Billiard now installs with a warning that the C extension could not be built
          if a compiler is not installed or the build fails in some other way.
        
            It really is recommended to have the C extension installed when running
            with force execv, but this change also makes it easier to install.
        
        - Pool: Hard timeouts now sends KILL shortly after TERM so that C extensions
          cannot block the signal.
        
            Python signal handlers are called in the interpreter, so they cannot
            be called while a C extension is blocking the interpreter from running.
        
        - Now uses a timeout value for Thread.join that doesn't exceed the maximum
          on some platforms.
        
        - Fixed bug in the SemLock fallback used when C extensions not installed.
        
            Fix contributed by Mher Movsisyan.
        
        - Pool: Now sets a Process.index attribute for every process in the pool.
        
            This number will always be between 0 and concurrency-1, and
            can be used to e.g. create a logfile for each process in the pool
            without creating a new logfile whenever a process is replaced.
        
        2.7.3.12 - 2012-08-05
        ---------------------
        
        - Fixed Python 2.5 compatibility issue.
        
        - New Pool.terminate_job(pid) to terminate a job without raising WorkerLostError
        
        2.7.3.11 - 2012-08-01
        ---------------------
        
        - Adds support for FreeBSD 7+
        
            Fix contributed by koobs.
        
        - Pool: New argument ``allow_restart`` is now required to enable
          the pool process sentinel that is required to restart the pool.
        
            It's disabled by default, which reduces the number of file
            descriptors/semaphores required to run the pool.
        
        - Pool: Now emits a warning if a worker process exited with error-code.
        
            But not if the error code is 155, which is now returned if the worker
            process was recycled (maxtasksperchild).
        
        - Python 3 compatibility fixes.
        
        - Python 2.5 compatibility fixes.
        
        2.7.3.10 - 2012-06-26
        ---------------------
        
        - The ``TimeLimitExceeded`` exception string representation
          only included the seconds as a number, it now gives a more human
          friendly description.
        
        - Fixed typo in ``LaxBoundedSemaphore.shrink``.
        
        - Pool: ``ResultHandler.handle_event`` no longer requires
          any arguments.
        
        - setup.py bdist now works
        
        2.7.3.9 - 2012-06-03
        --------------------
        
        - Environment variable ``MP_MAIN_FILE`` envvar is now set to
          the path of the ``__main__`` module when execv is enabled.
        
        - Pool: Errors occurring in the TaskHandler are now reported.
        
        2.7.3.8 - 2012-06-01
        --------------------
        
        - Can now be installed on Py 3.2
        
        - Issue #12091: simplify ApplyResult and MapResult with threading.Event
        
          Patch by Charles-Francois Natali
        
        - Pool: Support running without TimeoutHandler thread.
        
            - The with_*_thread arguments has also been replaced with
              a single `threads=True` argument.
        
            - Two new pool callbacks:
        
                - ``on_timeout_set(job, soft, hard)``
        
                    Applied when a task is executed with a timeout.
        
                - ``on_timeout_cancel(job)``
        
                    Applied when a timeout is cancelled (the job completed)
        
        2.7.3.7 - 2012-05-21
        --------------------
        
        - Fixes Python 2.5 support.
        
        2.7.3.6 - 2012-05-21
        --------------------
        
        - Pool: Can now be used in an event loop, without starting the supporting
          threads (TimeoutHandler still not supported)
        
            To facilitate this the pool has gained the following keyword arguments:
        
                - ``with_task_thread``
                - ``with_result_thread``
                - ``with_supervisor_thread``
                - ``on_process_up``
        
                    Callback called with Process instance as argument
                    whenever a new worker process is added.
        
                    Used to add new process fds to the eventloop::
        
                        def on_process_up(proc):
                            hub.add_reader(proc.sentinel, pool.maintain_pool)
        
                - ``on_process_down``
        
                    Callback called with Process instance as argument
                    whenever a new worker process is found dead.
        
                    Used to remove process fds from the eventloop::
        
                        def on_process_down(proc):
                            hub.remove(proc.sentinel)
        
                - ``semaphore``
        
                    Sets the semaphore used to protect from adding new items to the
                    pool when no processes available.  The default is a threaded
                    one, so this can be used to change to an async semaphore.
        
            And the following attributes::
        
                - ``readers``
        
                    A map of ``fd`` -> ``callback``, to be registered in an eventloop.
                    Currently this is only the result outqueue with a callback
                    that processes all currently incoming results.
        
            And the following methods::
        
                - ``did_start_ok``
        
                    To be called after starting the pool, and after setting up the
                    eventloop with the pool fds, to ensure that the worker processes
                    didn't immediately exit caused by an error (internal/memory).
        
                - ``maintain_pool``
        
                    Public version of ``_maintain_pool`` that handles max restarts.
        
        - Pool: Process too frequent restart protection now only counts if the process
          had a non-successful exit-code.
        
            This to take into account the maxtasksperchild option, and allowing
            processes to exit cleanly on their own.
        
        - Pool: New options max_restart + max_restart_freq
        
            This means that the supervisor can't restart processes
            faster than max_restart' times per max_restart_freq seconds
            (like the Erlang supervisor maxR & maxT settings).
        
            The pool is closed and joined if the max restart
            frequency is exceeded, where previously it would keep restarting
            at an unlimited rate, possibly crashing the system.
        
            The current default value is to stop if it exceeds
            100 * process_count restarts in 1 seconds.  This may change later.
        
            It will only count processes with an unsuccessful exit code,
            this is to take into account the ``maxtasksperchild`` setting
            and code that voluntarily exits.
        
        - Pool: The ``WorkerLostError`` message now includes the exit-code of the
          process that disappeared.
        
        
        2.7.3.5 - 2012-05-09
        --------------------
        
        - Now always cleans up after ``sys.exc_info()`` to avoid
          cyclic references.
        
        - ExceptionInfo without arguments now defaults to ``sys.exc_info``.
        
        - Forking can now be disabled using the
          ``MULTIPROCESSING_FORKING_DISABLE`` environment variable.
        
            Also this envvar is set so that the behavior is inherited
            after execv.
        
        - The semaphore cleanup process started when execv is used
          now sets a useful process name if the ``setproctitle``
          module is installed.
        
        - Sets the ``FORKED_BY_MULTIPROCESSING``
          environment variable if forking is disabled.
        
        
        2.7.3.4 - 2012-04-27
        --------------------
        
        - Added `billiard.ensure_multiprocessing()`
        
            Raises NotImplementedError if the platform does not support
            multiprocessing (e.g. Jython).
        
        
        2.7.3.3 - 2012-04-23
        --------------------
        
        - PyPy now falls back to using its internal _multiprocessing module,
          so everything works except for forking_enable(False) (which
          silently degrades).
        
        - Fixed Python 2.5 compat. issues.
        
        - Uses more with statements
        
        - Merged some of the changes from the Python 3 branch.
        
        2.7.3.2 - 2012-04-20
        --------------------
        
        - Now installs on PyPy/Jython (but does not work).
        
        2.7.3.1 - 2012-04-20
        --------------------
        
        - Python 2.5 support added.
        
        2.7.3.0 - 2012-04-20
        --------------------
        
        - Updated from Python 2.7.3
        
        - Python 2.4 support removed, now only supports 2.5, 2.6 and 2.7.
          (may consider py3k support at some point).
        
        - Pool improvements from Celery.
        
        - no-execv patch added (http://bugs.python.org/issue8713)
