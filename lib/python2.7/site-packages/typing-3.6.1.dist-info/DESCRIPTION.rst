Typing -- Type Hints for Python

This is a backport of the standard library typing module to Python
versions older than 3.6.

Typing defines a standard notation for Python function and variable
type annotations. The notation can be used for documenting code in a
concise, standard format, and it has been designed to also be used by
static and runtime type checkers, static analyzers, IDEs and other
tools.
