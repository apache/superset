kombu.transport.qpid
=======================

`Qpid`_ transport using `qpid-python`_ as the client and `qpid-tools`_ for
broker management.

The use this transport you must install the necessary dependencies. These
dependencies are available via PyPI and can be installed using the pip
command:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install kombu[qpid]

or to install the requirements manually:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install qpid-tools qpid-python

.. admonition:: Python 3 and PyPy Limitations

    The Qpid transport does not support Python 3 or PyPy environments due
    to underlying dependencies not being compatible. This version is
    tested and works with with Python 2.7.

.. _`Qpid`: http://qpid.apache.org/
.. _`qpid-python`: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/qpid-python/
.. _`qpid-tools`: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/qpid-tools/

Authentication
==============

This transport supports SASL authentication with the Qpid broker. Normally,
SASL mechanisms are negotiated from a client list and a server list of
possible mechanisms, but in practice, different SASL client libraries give
different behaviors. These different behaviors cause the expected SASL
mechanism to not be selected in many cases. As such, this transport restricts
the mechanism types based on Kombu's configuration according to the following
table.

+------------------------------------+--------------------+
| **Broker String**                  | **SASL Mechanism** |
+------------------------------------+--------------------+
| qpid://hostname/                   | ANONYMOUS          |
+------------------------------------+--------------------+
| qpid://username:password@hostname/ | PLAIN              |
+------------------------------------+--------------------+
| see instructions below             | EXTERNAL           |
+------------------------------------+--------------------+

The user can override the above SASL selection behaviors and specify the SASL
string using the :attr:`~kombu.Connection.login_method` argument to the
:class:`~kombu.Connection` object. The string can be a single SASL mechanism
or a space separated list of SASL mechanisms. If you are using Celery with
Kombu, this can be accomplished by setting the *BROKER_LOGIN_METHOD* Celery
option.

.. note::

    While using SSL, Qpid users may want to override the SASL mechanism to
    use *EXTERNAL*. In that case, Qpid requires a username to be presented
    that matches the *CN* of the SSL client certificate. Ensure that the
    broker string contains the corresponding username. For example, if the
    client certificate has *CN=asdf* and the client connects to *example.com*
    on port 5671, the broker string should be:

        **qpid://asdf@example.com:5671/**

Transport Options
=================

The :attr:`~kombu.Connection.transport_options` argument to the
:class:`~kombu.Connection` object are passed directly to the
:class:`qpid.messaging.endpoints.Connection` as keyword arguments. These
options override and replace any other default or specified values. If using
Celery, this can be accomplished by setting the
*BROKER_TRANSPORT_OPTIONS* Celery option.

    :param transport: The Transport this Channel is associated with.
    :type transport: kombu.transport.qpid.Transport

    A channel object is designed to have method-parity with a Channel as
    defined in AMQP 0-10 and earlier, which allows for the following broker
    actions:

        - exchange declare and delete
        - queue declare and delete
        - queue bind and unbind operations
        - queue length and purge operations
        - sending/receiving/rejecting messages
        - structuring, encoding, and decoding messages
        - supports synchronous and asynchronous reads
        - reading state about the exchange, queues, and bindings

    Channels are designed to all share a single TCP connection with a
    broker, but provide a level of isolated communication with the broker
    while benefiting from a shared TCP connection. The Channel is given
    its :class:`~kombu.transport.qpid.Connection` object by the
    :class:`~kombu.transport.qpid.Transport` that
    instantiates the channel.

    This channel inherits from :class:`~kombu.transport.base.StdChannel`,
    which makes this a 'native' channel versus a 'virtual' channel which
    would inherit from :class:`kombu.transports.virtual`.

    Messages sent using this channel are assigned a delivery_tag. The
    delivery_tag is generated for a message as they are prepared for
    sending by :meth:`basic_publish`. The delivery_tag is unique per
    channel instance. The delivery_tag has no meaningful context in other
    objects, and is only maintained in the memory of this object, and the
    underlying :class:`QoS` object that provides support.

    Each channel object instantiates exactly one :class:`QoS` object for
    prefetch limiting, and asynchronous ACKing. The :class:`QoS` object is
    lazily instantiated through a property method :meth:`qos`. The
    :class:`QoS` object is a supporting object that should not be accessed
    directly except by the channel itself.

    Synchronous reads on a queue are done using a call to :meth:`basic_get`
    which uses :meth:`_get` to perform the reading. These methods read
    immediately and do not accept any form of timeout. :meth:`basic_get`
    reads synchronously and ACKs messages before returning them. ACKing is
    done in all cases, because an application that reads messages using
    qpid.messaging, but does not ACK them will experience a memory leak.
    The no_ack argument to :meth:`basic_get` does not affect ACKing
    functionality.

    Asynchronous reads on a queue are done by starting a consumer using
    :meth:`basic_consume`. Each call to :meth:`basic_consume` will cause a
    :class:`~qpid.messaging.endpoints.Receiver` to be created on the
    :class:`~qpid.messaging.endpoints.Session` started by the :class:
    `Transport`. The receiver will asynchronously read using
    qpid.messaging, and prefetch messages before the call to
    :meth:`Transport.basic_drain` occurs. The prefetch_count value of the
    :class:`QoS` object is the capacity value of the new receiver. The new
    receiver capacity must always be at least 1, otherwise none of the
    receivers will appear to be ready for reading, and will never be read
    from.

    Each call to :meth:`basic_consume` creates a consumer, which is given a
    consumer tag that is identified by the caller of :meth:`basic_consume`.
    Already started consumers can be cancelled using by their consumer_tag
    using :meth:`basic_cancel`. Cancellation of a consumer causes the
    :class:`~qpid.messaging.endpoints.Receiver` object to be closed.

    Asynchronous message ACKing is supported through :meth:`basic_ack`,
    and is referenced by delivery_tag. The Channel object uses its
    :class:`QoS` object to perform the message ACKing.

        may only be consumed by the current connection. Setting the
        'exclusive' flag always implies 'auto-delete'. Default is False.

        If auto_delete is True,  the queue is deleted when all consumers
        have finished using it. The last consumer can be cancelled either
        explicitly or because its channel is closed. If there was no
        consumer ever on the queue, it won't be deleted. Default is True.

        The nowait parameter is unused. It was part of the 0-9-1 protocol,
        but this AMQP client implements 0-10 which removed the nowait option.

        The arguments parameter is a set of arguments for the declaration of
        the queue. Arguments are passed as a dict or None. This field is
        ignored if passive is True. Default is None.

        This method returns a :class:`~collections.namedtuple` with the name
        'queue_declare_ok_t' and the queue name as 'queue', message count
        on the queue as 'message_count', and the number of active consumers
        as 'consumer_count'. The named tuple values are ordered as queue,
        message_count, and consumer_count respectively.

        Due to Celery's non-ACKing of events, a ring policy is set on any
        queue that starts with the string 'celeryev' or ends with the string
        'pidbox'. These are celery event queues, and Celery does not ack
        them, causing the messages to build-up. Eventually Qpid stops serving
        messages unless the 'ring' policy is set, at which point the buffer
        backing the queue becomes circular.

        ConnectionError is listed as a recoverable error type, so kombu

        the operation without adjusting the credentials is not correct,

        not be considered recoverable.


    A connection object is created by a

    :meth:`~kombu.transport.qpid.Transport.establish_connection`.  The
    :class:`~kombu.transport.qpid.Transport` passes in
    connection options as keywords that should be used for any connections
    created. Each :class:`~kombu.transport.qpid.Transport` creates exactly
    one Connection.

    A Connection object maintains a reference to a
    :class:`~qpid.messaging.endpoints.Connection` which can be accessed
    through a bound getter method named :meth:`get_qpid_connection` method.
    Each Channel uses a the Connection for each
    :class:`~qpidtoollibs.BrokerAgent`, and the Transport maintains a session
    for all senders and receivers.

    The Connection object is also responsible for maintaining the
    dictionary of references to callbacks that should be called when
    messages are received. These callbacks are saved in _callbacks,
    and keyed on the queue name associated with the received message. The
    _callbacks are setup in :meth:`Channel.basic_consume`, removed in
    :meth:`Channel.basic_cancel`, and called in
    :meth:`Transport.drain_events`.

        all available events are drained through a call to
        :meth:`drain_events`.

        The file descriptor self.r is modified to be non-blocking, ensuring
        that an accidental call to this method when no more messages will
        not cause indefinite blocking.

        Nothing is expected to be returned from :meth:`drain_events` because
        :meth:`drain_events` handles messages by calling callbacks that are
        maintained on the :class:`~kombu.transport.qpid.Connection` object.
        When :meth:`drain_events` returns, all associated messages have been

        This method calls drain_events() which reads as many messages as are
        available for this Transport, and then returns. It blocks in the
        sense that reading and handling a large number of messages may take
        time, but it does not block waiting for a new message to arrive. When
        :meth:`drain_events` is called a timeout is not specified, which
        causes this behavior.

        One interesting behavior of note is where multiple messages are
        ready, and this method removes a single '0' character from
        self.r, but :meth:`drain_events` may handle an arbitrary amount of
        messages. In that case, extra '0' characters may be left on self.r
        to be read, where messages corresponding with those '0' characters
        have already been handled. The external epoll loop will incorrectly
        think additional data is ready for reading, and will call
        on_readable unnecessarily, once for each '0' to be read. Additional
        calls to :meth:`on_readable` produce no negative side effects,
        and will eventually clear out the symbols from the self.r file
