         kombu - Messaging library for Python
        ========================================
        
        :Version: 3.0.37
        
        `Kombu` is a messaging library for Python.
        
        The aim of `Kombu` is to make messaging in Python as easy as possible by
        providing an idiomatic high-level interface for the AMQ protocol, and also
        provide proven and tested solutions to common messaging problems.
        
        `AMQP`_ is the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol, an open standard protocol
        for message orientation, queuing, routing, reliability and security,
        for which the `RabbitMQ`_ messaging server is the most popular implementation.
        
        Features
        ========
        
        * Allows application authors to support several message server
          solutions by using pluggable transports.
        
            * AMQP transport using the `py-amqp`_, `librabbitmq`_, or `qpid-python`_ client libraries.
        
            * High performance AMQP transport written in C - when using `librabbitmq`_
        
              This is automatically enabled if librabbitmq is installed::
        
                $ pip install librabbitmq
        
            * Virtual transports makes it really easy to add support for non-AMQP
              transports.  There is already built-in support for `Redis`_,
              `Beanstalk`_, `Amazon SQS`_, `CouchDB`_, `MongoDB`_, `ZeroMQ`_,
              `ZooKeeper`_, `SoftLayer MQ`_ and `Pyro`_.
        
            * You can also use the SQLAlchemy and Django ORM transports to
              use a database as the broker.
        
            * In-memory transport for unit testing.
        
        * Supports automatic encoding, serialization and compression of message
          payloads.
        
        * Consistent exception handling across transports.
        
        * The ability to ensure that an operation is performed by gracefully
          handling connection and channel errors.
        
        * Several annoyances with `amqplib`_ has been fixed, like supporting
          timeouts and the ability to wait for events on more than one channel.
        
        * Projects already using `carrot`_ can easily be ported by using
          a compatibility layer.
        
        For an introduction to AMQP you should read the article `Rabbits and warrens`_,
        and the `Wikipedia article about AMQP`_.

        Documentation
        -------------
        
        Kombu is using Sphinx, and the latest documentation can be found here:
        
            https://kombu.readthedocs.io/
        
        Quick overview
        --------------
        
        ::
        
            from kombu import Connection, Exchange, Queue
        
            media_exchange = Exchange('media', 'direct', durable=True)
            video_queue = Queue('video', exchange=media_exchange, routing_key='video')
        
            def process_media(body, message):
                print body
                message.ack()
        
            # connections
            with Connection('amqp://guest:guest@localhost//') as conn:
        
                # produce
                producer = conn.Producer(serializer='json')
                producer.publish({'name': '/tmp/lolcat1.avi', 'size': 1301013},
                                  exchange=media_exchange, routing_key='video',
                                  declare=[video_queue])
        
                # the declare above, makes sure the video queue is declared
                # so that the messages can be delivered.
                # It's a best practice in Kombu to have both publishers and
                # consumers declare the queue.  You can also declare the
                # queue manually using:
                #     video_queue(conn).declare()
        
                # consume
                with conn.Consumer(video_queue, callbacks=[process_media]) as consumer:
                    # Process messages and handle events on all channels
                    while True:
                        conn.drain_events()
        
            # Consume from several queues on the same channel:
            video_queue = Queue('video', exchange=media_exchange, key='video')
            image_queue = Queue('image', exchange=media_exchange, key='image')
        
            with connection.Consumer([video_queue, image_queue],
                                     callbacks=[process_media]) as consumer:
                while True:
                    connection.drain_events()
        
        
        Or handle channels manually::
        
            with connection.channel() as channel:
                producer = Producer(channel, ...)
                consumer = Producer(channel)
        
        
        All objects can be used outside of with statements too,
        just remember to close the objects after use::
        
            from kombu import Connection, Consumer, Producer
        
            connection = Connection()
                # ...
            connection.release()
        
            consumer = Consumer(channel_or_connection, ...)
            consumer.register_callback(my_callback)
            consumer.consume()
                # ....
            consumer.cancel()
        
        
        `Exchange` and `Queue` are simply declarations that can be pickled
        and used in configuration files etc.
        
        They also support operations, but to do so they need to be bound
        to a channel.
        
        Binding exchanges and queues to a connection will make it use
        that connections default channel.
        
        ::
        
            >>> exchange = Exchange('tasks', 'direct')
        
            >>> connection = Connection()
            >>> bound_exchange = exchange(connection)
            >>> bound_exchange.delete()
        
            # the original exchange is not affected, and stays unbound.
            >>> exchange.delete()
            raise NotBoundError: Can't call delete on Exchange not bound to
                a channel.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        You can install `Kombu` either via the Python Package Index (PyPI)
        or from source.
        
        To install using `pip`,::
        
            $ pip install kombu
        
        To install using `easy_install`,::
        
            $ easy_install kombu
        
        If you have downloaded a source tarball you can install it
        by doing the following,::
        
            $ python setup.py build
            # python setup.py install # as root
        
        
        Terminology
        ===========
        
        There are some concepts you should be familiar with before starting:
        
            * Producers
        
                Producers sends messages to an exchange.
        
            * Exchanges
        
                Messages are sent to exchanges. Exchanges are named and can be
                configured to use one of several routing algorithms. The exchange
                routes the messages to consumers by matching the routing key in the
                message with the routing key the consumer provides when binding to
                the exchange.
        
            * Consumers
        
                Consumers declares a queue, binds it to a exchange and receives
                messages from it.
        
            * Queues
        
                Queues receive messages sent to exchanges. The queues are declared
                by consumers.
        
            * Routing keys
        
                Every message has a routing key.  The interpretation of the routing
                key depends on the exchange type. There are four default exchange
                types defined by the AMQP standard, and vendors can define custom
                types (so see your vendors manual for details).
        
                These are the default exchange types defined by AMQP/0.8:
        
                    * Direct exchange
        
                        Matches if the routing key property of the message and
                        the `routing_key` attribute of the consumer are identical.
        
                    * Fan-out exchange
        
                        Always matches, even if the binding does not have a routing
                        key.
        
                    * Topic exchange
        
                        Matches the routing key property of the message by a primitive
                        pattern matching scheme. The message routing key then consists
                        of words separated by dots (`"."`, like domain names), and
                        two special characters are available; star (`"*"`) and hash
                        (`"#"`). The star matches any word, and the hash matches
                        zero or more words. For example `"*.stock.#"` matches the
                        routing keys `"usd.stock"` and `"eur.stock.db"` but not
                        `"stock.nasdaq"`.
