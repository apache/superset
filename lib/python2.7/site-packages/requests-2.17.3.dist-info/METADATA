Requests is the only *Non-GMO* HTTP library for Python, safe for human
consumption.

**Warning:** Recreational use of the Python standard library for HTTP may result in dangerous side-effects,
including: security vulnerabilities, verbose code, reinventing the wheel,
constantly reading documentation, depression, headaches, or even death.

Behold, the power of Requests:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> r = requests.get('https://api.github.com/user', auth=('user', 'pass'))
    >>> r.status_code
    200
    >>> r.headers['content-type']
    'application/json; charset=utf8'
    >>> r.encoding
    'utf-8'
    >>> r.text
    u'{"type":"User"...'
    >>> r.json()
    {u'disk_usage': 368627, u'private_gists': 484, ...}

See `the similar code, sans Requests <https://gist.github.com/973705>`_.

Requests allows you to send *organic, grass-fed* HTTP/1.1 requests, without the
need for manual labor. There's no need to manually add query strings to your
URLs, or to form-encode your POST data. Keep-alive and HTTP connection pooling
are 100% automatic, thanks to `urllib3 <https://github.com/shazow/urllib3>`_.

Besides, all the cool kids are doing it. Requests is one of the most
downloaded Python packages of all time, pulling in over 11,000,000 downloads
every month. You don't want to be left out!

Release History
---------------

2.17.2 (2017-05-29)
+++++++++++++++++++

**Improvements**

- Improved ``packages`` namespace identity support, for monkeypatching libraries.


2.17.1 (2017-05-29)
+++++++++++++++++++

**Improvements**

- Improved ``packages`` namespace identity support, for monkeypatching libraries.


2.17.0 (2017-05-29)
+++++++++++++++++++

**Improvements**

- Removal of the 301 redirect cache. This improves thread-safety.


2.16.5 (2017-05-28)
+++++++++++++++++++

- Improvements to ``$ python -m requests.help``.

2.16.4 (2017-05-27)
+++++++++++++++++++

- Introduction of the ``$ python -m requests.help`` command, for debugging with maintainers!

2.16.3 (2017-05-27)
+++++++++++++++++++

- Further restored the ``requests.packages`` namespace for compatibility reasons.

2.16.2 (2017-05-27)
+++++++++++++++++++

- Further restored the ``requests.packages`` namespace for compatibility reasons.

No code modification (noted below) should be neccessary any longer.

2.16.1 (2017-05-27)
+++++++++++++++++++

- Restored the ``requests.packages`` namespace for compatibility reasons.
- Bugfix for ``urllib3`` version parsing.

**Note**: code that was written to import against the ``requests.packages``
namespace previously will have to import code that rests at this module-level
now.

For example::

    from requests.packages.urllib3.poolmanager import PoolManager

Will need to be re-written to be::

    from requests.packages import urllib3
    urllib3.poolmanager.PoolManager

Or, even better::

    from urllib3.poolmanager import PoolManager

2.16.0 (2017-05-26)
+++++++++++++++++++

- Unvendor ALL the things!

2.15.1 (2017-05-26)
+++++++++++++++++++

- Everyone makes mistakes.

2.15.0 (2017-05-26)
+++++++++++++++++++

**Improvements**

- Introduction of the ``Response.next`` property, for getting the next
  ``PreparedResponse`` from a redirect chain (when ``allow_redirects=False``).
- Internal refactoring of ``__version__`` module.

**Bugfixes**

- Restored once-optional parameter for ``requests.utils.get_environ_proxies()``.

2.14.2 (2017-05-10)
+++++++++++++++++++

**Bugfixes**

- Changed a less-than to an equal-to and an or in the dependency markers to
  widen compatibility with older setuptools releases.

2.14.1 (2017-05-09)
+++++++++++++++++++

**Bugfixes**

- Changed the dependency markers to widen compatibility with older pip
  releases.

2.14.0 (2017-05-09)
+++++++++++++++++++

**Improvements**

- It is now possible to pass ``no_proxy`` as a key to the ``proxies``
  dictionary to provide handling similar to the ``NO_PROXY`` environment
  variable.
- When users provide invalid paths to certificate bundle files or directories
  Requests now raises ``IOError``, rather than failing at the time of the HTTPS
  request with a fairly inscrutable certificate validation error.
- The behavior of ``SessionRedirectMixin`` was slightly altered.
  ``resolve_redirects`` will now detect a redirect by calling
  ``get_redirect_target(response)`` instead of directly
  querying ``Response.is_redirect`` and ``Response.headers['location']``.
  Advanced users will be able to process malformed redirects more easily.
- Changed the internal calculation of elapsed request time to have higher
  resolution on Windows.
- Added ``win_inet_pton`` as conditional dependency for the ``[socks]`` extra
  on Windows with Python 2.7.
- Changed the proxy bypass implementation on Windows: the proxy bypass
  check doesn't use forward and reverse DNS requests anymore
- URLs with schemes that begin with ``http`` but are not ``http`` or ``https``
  no longer have their host parts forced to lowercase.

**Bugfixes**

- Much improved handling of non-ASCII ``Location`` header values in redirects.
  Fewer ``UnicodeDecodeErrors`` are encountered on Python 2, and Python 3 now
  correctly understands that Latin-1 is unlikely to be the correct encoding.
- If an attempt to ``seek`` file to find out its length fails, we now
  appropriately handle that by aborting our content-length calculations.
- Restricted ``HTTPDigestAuth`` to only respond to auth challenges made on 4XX
  responses, rather than to all auth challenges.
- Fixed some code that was firing ``DeprecationWarning`` on Python 3.6.
- The dismayed person emoticon (``/o\\``) no longer has a big head. I'm sure
  this is what you were all worrying about most.


**Miscellaneous**

- Updated bundled urllib3 to v1.21.1.
- Updated bundled chardet to v3.0.2.
- Updated bundled idna to v2.5.
- Updated bundled certifi to 2017.4.17.

2.13.0 (2017-01-24)
+++++++++++++++++++

**Features**

- Only load the ``idna`` library when we've determined we need it. This will
  save some memory for users.

**Miscellaneous**

- Updated bundled urllib3 to 1.20.
- Updated bundled idna to 2.2.

2.12.5 (2017-01-18)
+++++++++++++++++++

**Bugfixes**

- Fixed an issue with JSON encoding detection, specifically detecting
  big-endian UTF-32 with BOM.

2.12.4 (2016-12-14)
+++++++++++++++++++

**Bugfixes**

- Fixed regression from 2.12.2 where non-string types were rejected in the
  basic auth parameters. While support for this behaviour has been readded,
  the behaviour is deprecated and will be removed in the future.

2.12.3 (2016-12-01)
+++++++++++++++++++

**Bugfixes**

- Fixed regression from v2.12.1 for URLs with schemes that begin with "http".
  These URLs have historically been processed as though they were HTTP-schemed
  URLs, and so have had parameters added. This was removed in v2.12.2 in an
  overzealous attempt to resolve problems with IDNA-encoding those URLs. This
  change was reverted: the other fixes for IDNA-encoding have been judged to
  be sufficient to return to the behaviour Requests had before v2.12.0.

2.12.2 (2016-11-30)
+++++++++++++++++++

**Bugfixes**

- Fixed several issues with IDNA-encoding URLs that are technically invalid but
  which are widely accepted. Requests will now attempt to IDNA-encode a URL if
  it can but, if it fails, and the host contains only ASCII characters, it will
  be passed through optimistically. This will allow users to opt-in to using
  IDNA2003 themselves if they want to, and will also allow technically invalid
  but still common hostnames.
- Fixed an issue where URLs with leading whitespace would raise
  ``InvalidSchema`` errors.
- Fixed an issue where some URLs without the HTTP or HTTPS schemes would still
  have HTTP URL preparation applied to them.
- Fixed an issue where Unicode strings could not be used in basic auth.
- Fixed an issue encountered by some Requests plugins where constructing a
  Response object would cause ``Response.content`` to raise an
  ``AttributeError``.

2.12.1 (2016-11-16)
+++++++++++++++++++

**Bugfixes**

- Updated setuptools 'security' extra for the new PyOpenSSL backend in urllib3.

**Miscellaneous**

- Updated bundled urllib3 to 1.19.1.

2.12.0 (2016-11-15)
+++++++++++++++++++

**Improvements**

- Updated support for internationalized domain names from IDNA2003 to IDNA2008.
  This updated support is required for several forms of IDNs and is mandatory
  for .de domains.
- Much improved heuristics for guessing content lengths: Requests will no
  longer read an entire ``StringIO`` into memory.
- Much improved logic for recalculating ``Content-Length`` headers for
  ``PreparedRequest`` objects.
- Improved tolerance for file-like objects that have no ``tell`` method but
  do have a ``seek`` method.
- Anything that is a subclass of ``Mapping`` is now treated like a dictionary
  by the ``data=`` keyword argument.
- Requests now tolerates empty passwords in proxy credentials, rather than
  stripping the credentials.
- If a request is made with a file-like object as the body and that request is
  redirected with a 307 or 308 status code, Requests will now attempt to
  rewind the body object so it can be replayed.

**Bugfixes**

- When calling ``response.close``, the call to ``close`` will be propagated
  through to non-urllib3 backends.
- Fixed issue where the ``ALL_PROXY`` environment variable would be preferred
  over scheme-specific variables like ``HTTP_PROXY``.
- Fixed issue where non-UTF8 reason phrases got severely mangled by falling
  back to decoding using ISO 8859-1 instead.
- Fixed a bug where Requests would not correctly correlate cookies set when
  using custom Host headers if those Host headers did not use the native
  string type for the platform.

**Miscellaneous**

- Updated bundled urllib3 to 1.19.
- Updated bundled certifi certs to 2016.09.26.

2.11.1 (2016-08-17)
+++++++++++++++++++

**Bugfixes**

- Fixed a bug when using ``iter_content`` with ``decode_unicode=True`` for
  streamed bodies would raise ``AttributeError``. This bug was introduced in
  2.11.
- Strip Content-Type and Transfer-Encoding headers from the header block when
  following a redirect that transforms the verb from POST/PUT to GET.

2.11.0 (2016-08-08)
+++++++++++++++++++

**Improvements**

- Added support for the ``ALL_PROXY`` environment variable.
- Reject header values that contain leading whitespace or newline characters to
  reduce risk of header smuggling.

**Bugfixes**

- Fixed occasional ``TypeError`` when attempting to decode a JSON response that
  occurred in an error case. Now correctly returns a ``ValueError``.
- Requests would incorrectly ignore a non-CIDR IP address in the ``NO_PROXY``
  environment variables: Requests now treats it as a specific IP.
- Fixed a bug when sending JSON data that could cause us to encounter obscure
  OpenSSL errors in certain network conditions (yes, really).
- Added type checks to ensure that ``iter_content`` only accepts integers and
  ``None`` for chunk sizes.
- Fixed issue where responses whose body had not been fully consumed would have
  the underlying connection closed but not returned to the connection pool,
  which could cause Requests to hang in situations where the ``HTTPAdapter``
  had been configured to use a blocking connection pool.

**Miscellaneous**

- Updated bundled urllib3 to 1.16.
- Some previous releases accidentally accepted non-strings as acceptable header values. This release does not.

2.10.0 (2016-04-29)
+++++++++++++++++++

**New Features**

- SOCKS Proxy Support! (requires PySocks; ``$ pip install requests[socks]``)

**Miscellaneous**

- Updated bundled urllib3 to 1.15.1.

2.9.2 (2016-04-29)
++++++++++++++++++

**Improvements**

- Change built-in CaseInsensitiveDict (used for headers) to use OrderedDict
  as its underlying datastore.

**Bugfixes**

- Don't use redirect_cache if allow_redirects=False
- When passed objects that throw exceptions from ``tell()``, send them via
  chunked transfer encoding instead of failing.
- Raise a ProxyError for proxy related connection issues.

2.9.1 (2015-12-21)
++++++++++++++++++

**Bugfixes**

- Resolve regression introduced in 2.9.0 that made it impossible to send binary
  strings as bodies in Python 3.
- Fixed errors when calculating cookie expiration dates in certain locales.

**Miscellaneous**

- Updated bundled urllib3 to 1.13.1.

2.9.0 (2015-12-15)
++++++++++++++++++

**Minor Improvements** (Backwards compatible)

- The ``verify`` keyword argument now supports being passed a path to a
  directory of CA certificates, not just a single-file bundle.
- Warnings are now emitted when sending files opened in text mode.
- Added the 511 Network Authentication Required status code to the status code
  registry.

**Bugfixes**

- For file-like objects that are not seeked to the very beginning, we now
  send the content length for the number of bytes we will actually read, rather
  than the total size of the file, allowing partial file uploads.
- When uploading file-like objects, if they are empty or have no obvious
  content length we set ``Transfer-Encoding: chunked`` rather than
  ``Content-Length: 0``.
- We correctly receive the response in buffered mode when uploading chunked
  bodies.
- We now handle being passed a query string as a bytestring on Python 3, by
  decoding it as UTF-8.
- Sessions are now closed in all cases (exceptional and not) when using the
  functional API rather than leaking and waiting for the garbage collector to
  clean them up.
- Correctly handle digest auth headers with a malformed ``qop`` directive that
  contains no token, by treating it the same as if no ``qop`` directive was
  provided at all.
- Minor performance improvements when removing specific cookies by name.

**Miscellaneous**

- Updated urllib3 to 1.13.

2.8.1 (2015-10-13)
++++++++++++++++++

**Bugfixes**

- Update certificate bundle to match ``certifi`` 2015.9.6.2's weak certificate
  bundle.
- Fix a bug in 2.8.0 where requests would raise ``ConnectTimeout`` instead of
  ``ConnectionError``
- When using the PreparedRequest flow, requests will now correctly respect the
  ``json`` parameter. Broken in 2.8.0.
- When using the PreparedRequest flow, requests will now correctly handle a
  Unicode-string method name on Python 2. Broken in 2.8.0.

2.8.0 (2015-10-05)
++++++++++++++++++

**Minor Improvements** (Backwards Compatible)

- Requests now supports per-host proxies. This allows the ``proxies``
  dictionary to have entries of the form
  ``{'<scheme>://<hostname>': '<proxy>'}``. Host-specific proxies will be used
  in preference to the previously-supported scheme-specific ones, but the
  previous syntax will continue to work.
- ``Response.raise_for_status`` now prints the URL that failed as part of the
  exception message.
- ``requests.utils.get_netrc_auth`` now takes an ``raise_errors`` kwarg,
  defaulting to ``False``. When ``True``, errors parsing ``.netrc`` files cause
  exceptions to be thrown.
- Change to bundled projects import logic to make it easier to unbundle
  requests downstream.
- Changed the default User-Agent string to avoid leaking data on Linux: now
  contains only the requests version.

**Bugfixes**

- The ``json`` parameter to ``post()`` and friends will now only be used if
  neither ``data`` nor ``files`` are present, consistent with the
  documentation.
- We now ignore empty fields in the ``NO_PROXY`` environment variable.
- Fixed problem where ``httplib.BadStatusLine`` would get raised if combining
  ``stream=True`` with ``contextlib.closing``.
- Prevented bugs where we would attempt to return the same connection back to
  the connection pool twice when sending a Chunked body.
- Miscellaneous minor internal changes.
- Digest Auth support is now thread safe.

**Updates**

- Updated urllib3 to 1.12.

2.7.0 (2015-05-03)
++++++++++++++++++

This is the first release that follows our new release process. For more, see
`our documentation
<http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/community/release-process/>`_.

**Bugfixes**

- Updated urllib3 to 1.10.4, resolving several bugs involving chunked transfer
  encoding and response framing.

2.6.2 (2015-04-23)
++++++++++++++++++

**Bugfixes**

- Fix regression where compressed data that was sent as chunked data was not
  properly decompressed. (#2561)

2.6.1 (2015-04-22)
++++++++++++++++++

**Bugfixes**

- Remove VendorAlias import machinery introduced in v2.5.2.

- Simplify the PreparedRequest.prepare API: We no longer require the user to
  pass an empty list to the hooks keyword argument. (c.f. #2552)

- Resolve redirects now receives and forwards all of the original arguments to
  the adapter. (#2503)

- Handle UnicodeDecodeErrors when trying to deal with a unicode URL that
  cannot be encoded in ASCII. (#2540)

- Populate the parsed path of the URI field when performing Digest
  Authentication. (#2426)

- Copy a PreparedRequest's CookieJar more reliably when it is not an instance
  of RequestsCookieJar. (#2527)

2.6.0 (2015-03-14)
++++++++++++++++++

**Bugfixes**

- CVE-2015-2296: Fix handling of cookies on redirect. Previously a cookie
  without a host value set would use the hostname for the redirected URL
  exposing requests users to session fixation attacks and potentially cookie
  stealing. This was disclosed privately by Matthew Daley of
  `BugFuzz <https://bugfuzz.com>`_. This affects all versions of requests from
  v2.1.0 to v2.5.3 (inclusive on both ends).

- Fix error when requests is an ``install_requires`` dependency and ``python
  setup.py test`` is run. (#2462)

- Fix error when urllib3 is unbundled and requests continues to use the
  vendored import location.

- Include fixes to ``urllib3``'s header handling.

- Requests' handling of unvendored dependencies is now more restrictive.

**Features and Improvements**

- Support bytearrays when passed as parameters in the ``files`` argument.
  (#2468)

- Avoid data duplication when creating a request with ``str``, ``bytes``, or
  ``bytearray`` input to the ``files`` argument.

2.5.3 (2015-02-24)
++++++++++++++++++

**Bugfixes**

- Revert changes to our vendored certificate bundle. For more context see
  (#2455, #2456, and http://bugs.python.org/issue23476)

2.5.2 (2015-02-23)
++++++++++++++++++

**Features and Improvements**

- Add sha256 fingerprint support. (`shazow/urllib3#540`_)

- Improve the performance of headers. (`shazow/urllib3#544`_)

**Bugfixes**

- Copy pip's import machinery. When downstream redistributors remove
  requests.packages.urllib3 the import machinery will continue to let those
  same symbols work. Example usage in requests' documentation and 3rd-party
  libraries relying on the vendored copies of urllib3 will work without having
  to fallback to the system urllib3.

- Attempt to quote parts of the URL on redirect if unquoting and then quoting
  fails. (#2356)

- Fix filename type check for multipart form-data uploads. (#2411)

- Properly handle the case where a server issuing digest authentication
  challenges provides both auth and auth-int qop-values. (#2408)

- Fix a socket leak. (`shazow/urllib3#549`_)

- Fix multiple ``Set-Cookie`` headers properly. (`shazow/urllib3#534`_)

- Disable the built-in hostname verification. (`shazow/urllib3#526`_)

- Fix the behaviour of decoding an exhausted stream. (`shazow/urllib3#535`_)

**Security**

- Pulled in an updated ``cacert.pem``.

- Drop RC4 from the default cipher list. (`shazow/urllib3#551`_)

++++++++++++++++++

**Bugfixes**

- Unicode URL improvements for Python 2.
- Re-order JSON param for backwards compat.
- Automatically defrag authentication schemes from host/pass URIs. (`#2249 <https://github.com/requests/requests/issues/2249>`_)

2.0.0 (2013-09-24)
++++++++++++++++++

**API Changes:**

- Keys in the Headers dictionary are now native strings on all Python versions,
  i.e. bytestrings on Python 2, unicode on Python 3.
- Proxy URLs now *must* have an explicit scheme. A ``MissingSchema`` exception
  will be raised if they don't.
- Timeouts now apply to read time if ``Stream=False``.
- ``RequestException`` is now a subclass of ``IOError``, not ``RuntimeError``.
- Added new method to ``PreparedRequest`` objects: ``PreparedRequest.copy()``.
- Added new method to ``Session`` objects: ``Session.update_request()``. This
  method updates a ``Request`` object with the data (e.g. cookies) stored on
  the ``Session``.
- Added new method to ``Session`` objects: ``Session.prepare_request()``. This
  method updates and prepares a ``Request`` object, and returns the
  corresponding ``PreparedRequest`` object.
- Added new method to ``HTTPAdapter`` objects: ``HTTPAdapter.proxy_headers()``.
  This should not be called directly, but improves the subclass interface.
- ``httplib.IncompleteRead`` exceptions caused by incorrect chunked encoding
  will now raise a Requests ``ChunkedEncodingError`` instead.
- Invalid percent-escape sequences now cause a Requests ``InvalidURL``
  exception to be raised.
