Description: Tornado Web Server
        ==================
        
        `Tornado <http://www.tornadoweb.org>`_ is a Python web framework and
        asynchronous networking library, originally developed at `FriendFeed
        <http://friendfeed.com>`_.  By using non-blocking network I/O, Tornado
        can scale to tens of thousands of open connections, making it ideal for
        `long polling <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Push_technology#Long_polling>`_,
        `WebSockets <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket>`_, and other
        applications that require a long-lived connection to each user.
        
        
        Upgrade notes
        -------------
        
        As of Tornado 3.2, the `backports.ssl_match_hostname
        <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/backports.ssl_match_hostname>`_ package
        must be installed when running Tornado on Python 2.  This will be
        installed automatically when using ``pip`` or ``easy_install``.

        Hello, world
        ------------
        
        Here is a simple "Hello, world" example web app for Tornado:
            
        .. code-block:: python
        
            import tornado.ioloop
            import tornado.web
        
            class MainHandler(tornado.web.RequestHandler):
                def get(self):
                    self.write("Hello, world")
        
            application = tornado.web.Application([
                (r"/", MainHandler),
            ])
        
            if __name__ == "__main__":
                application.listen(8888)
                tornado.ioloop.IOLoop.instance().start()
        
        This example does not use any of Tornado's asynchronous features; for
        that see this `simple chat room
        <https://github.com/tornadoweb/tornado/tree/stable/demos/chat>`_.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        **Automatic installation**::
        
            pip install tornado
        
        Tornado is listed in `PyPI <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/tornado/>`_ and
        can be installed with ``pip`` or ``easy_install``.  Note that the
        source distribution includes demo applications that are not present
        when Tornado is installed in this way, so you may wish to download a
        copy of the source tarball as well.
        
        **Manual installation**: Download the latest source from `PyPI
        <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/tornado/>`_.
        
        .. parsed-literal::
        
            tar xvzf tornado-$VERSION.tar.gz
            cd tornado-$VERSION
            python setup.py build
            sudo python setup.py install
        
        The Tornado source code is `hosted on GitHub
        <https://github.com/tornadoweb/tornado>`_.
        
        **Prerequisites**: Tornado runs on Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4.  It
        requires the `certifi <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/certifi>`_ package
        on all Python versions, and the `backports.ssl_match_hostname
        <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/backports.ssl_match_hostname>`_ package
        on Python 2.  These will be installed automatically when using
        ``pip`` or ``easy_install``).  Some Tornado features may
        require one of the following optional libraries:
        
        * `unittest2 <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/unittest2>`_ is needed to run
          Tornado's test suite on Python 2.6 (it is unnecessary on more recent
          versions of Python)
        * `concurrent.futures <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/futures>`_ is the
          recommended thread pool for use with Tornado and enables the use of
          ``tornado.netutil.ThreadedResolver``.  It is needed only on Python 2;
          Python 3 includes this package in the standard library.
        * `pycurl <http://pycurl.sourceforge.net>`_ is used by the optional
          ``tornado.curl_httpclient``.  Libcurl version 7.18.2 or higher is required;
          version 7.21.1 or higher is recommended.
        * `Twisted <http://www.twistedmatrix.com>`_ may be used with the classes in
          `tornado.platform.twisted`.
        * `pycares <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pycares>`_ is an alternative
          non-blocking DNS resolver that can be used when threads are not
          appropriate.
        * `Monotime <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Monotime>`_ adds support for
          a monotonic clock, which improves reliability in environments
          where clock adjustments are frequent.  No longer needed in Python 3.3.
        
        **Platforms**: Tornado should run on any Unix-like platform, although
        for the best performance and scalability only Linux (with ``epoll``)
        and BSD (with ``kqueue``) are recommended for production deployment
        (even though Mac OS X is derived from BSD and supports kqueue, its
        networking performance is generally poor so it is recommended only for
        development use).  Tornado will also run on Windows, although this
        configuration is not officially supported and is recommended only for
        development use.
