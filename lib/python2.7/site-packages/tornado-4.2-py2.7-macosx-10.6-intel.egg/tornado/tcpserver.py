class TCPServer(object):
    r"""A non-blocking, single-threaded TCP server.

    To use `TCPServer`, define a subclass which overrides the `handle_stream`
    method.

    To make this server serve SSL traffic, send the ``ssl_options`` keyword
    argument with an `ssl.SSLContext` object. For compatibility with older
    versions of Python ``ssl_options`` may also be a dictionary of keyword
    arguments for the `ssl.wrap_socket` method.::

       ssl_ctx = ssl.create_default_context(ssl.Purpose.CLIENT_AUTH)
       ssl_ctx.load_cert_chain(os.path.join(data_dir, "mydomain.crt"),
                               os.path.join(data_dir, "mydomain.key"))
       TCPServer(ssl_options=ssl_ctx)

    `TCPServer` initialization follows one of three patterns:

    1. `listen`: simple single-process::

            server = TCPServer()
            server.listen(8888)
            IOLoop.current().start()

    2. `bind`/`start`: simple multi-process::

            server = TCPServer()
            server.bind(8888)
            server.start(0)  # Forks multiple sub-processes
            IOLoop.current().start()

       When using this interface, an `.IOLoop` must *not* be passed
       to the `TCPServer` constructor.  `start` will always start
       the server on the default singleton `.IOLoop`.

    3. `add_sockets`: advanced multi-process::

            sockets = bind_sockets(8888)
            tornado.process.fork_processes(0)
            server = TCPServer()
            server.add_sockets(sockets)
            IOLoop.current().start()

       The `add_sockets` interface is more complicated, but it can be
       used with `tornado.process.fork_processes` to give you more
       flexibility in when the fork happens.  `add_sockets` can
       also be used in single-process servers if you want to create
       your listening sockets in some way other than
       `~tornado.netutil.bind_sockets`.
