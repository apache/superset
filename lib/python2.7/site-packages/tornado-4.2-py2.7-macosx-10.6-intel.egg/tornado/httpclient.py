"""Blocking and non-blocking HTTP client interfaces.

This module defines a common interface shared by two implementations,
``simple_httpclient`` and ``curl_httpclient``.  Applications may either
instantiate their chosen implementation class directly or use the
`AsyncHTTPClient` class from this module, which selects an implementation
that can be overridden with the `AsyncHTTPClient.configure` method.

The default implementation is ``simple_httpclient``, and this is expected
to be suitable for most users' needs.  However, some applications may wish
to switch to ``curl_httpclient`` for reasons such as the following:

* ``curl_httpclient`` has some features not found in ``simple_httpclient``,
  including support for HTTP proxies and the ability to use a specified
  network interface.

* ``curl_httpclient`` is more likely to be compatible with sites that are
  not-quite-compliant with the HTTP spec, or sites that use little-exercised
  features of HTTP.

* ``curl_httpclient`` is faster.

* ``curl_httpclient`` was the default prior to Tornado 2.0.

Note that if you are using ``curl_httpclient``, it is highly
recommended that you use a recent version of ``libcurl`` and
``pycurl``.  Currently the minimum supported version of libcurl is
7.21.1, and the minimum version of pycurl is 7.18.2.  It is highly
recommended that your ``libcurl`` installation is built with
asynchronous DNS resolver (threaded or c-ares), otherwise you may
encounter various problems with request timeouts (for more
information, see
http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/curl_easy_setopt.html#CURLOPTCONNECTTIMEOUTMS
and comments in curl_httpclient.py).

To select ``curl_httpclient``, call `AsyncHTTPClient.configure` at startup::

    AsyncHTTPClient.configure("tornado.curl_httpclient.CurlAsyncHTTPClient")

    The constructor for this class is magic in several respects: It
    actually creates an instance of an implementation-specific
    subclass, and instances are reused as a kind of pseudo-singleton
    (one per `.IOLoop`).  The keyword argument ``force_instance=True``
    can be used to suppress this singleton behavior.  Unless
    ``force_instance=True`` is used, no arguments other than
    ``io_loop`` should be passed to the `AsyncHTTPClient` constructor.
    The implementation subclass as well as arguments to its
    constructor can be set with the static method `configure()`

    All `AsyncHTTPClient` implementations support a ``defaults``
    keyword argument, which can be used to set default values for
    `HTTPRequest` attributes.  For example::

        AsyncHTTPClient.configure(
            None, defaults=dict(user_agent="MyUserAgent"))
        # or with force_instance:
        client = AsyncHTTPClient(force_instance=True,
            defaults=dict(user_agent="MyUserAgent"))

            When using ``curl_httpclient`` certain options may be

            ``ca_certs``, ``client_key``, ``client_cert``, and
            ``network_interface`` arguments.  If you use these
            options, you should pass them on every request (you don't
            have to always use the same values, but it's not possible
            to mix requests that specify these options with ones that
            use the defaults).
